A Job Board is a bulletin upon which an authorized caretaker posts bounties meant to be undertaken by [[Fixer|Reparadores]], certified members of the [[Ordem de Reparação]]. These jobs typically revolve around dealing with some sort of problematic supernatural entity, though, depending on the location, can also involve finding missing individuals, investigating strange phenomenon or escorting people through dangerous territory.

Once a job has been accepted by a Fixer or a band, that notice is pulled from the board until it has been completed, or until the group has failed in their endeavor, at which point it can be returned to active posting. While there is no formal rule in the Order's charter, etiquette demands that Fixers only accept one job at a time - a professional courtesy followed even by Fixers that have attained legendary status.

Returning without completing a job isn't uncommon, but is generally seen as a great failure, and often results in getting less preferential jobs in the future. Reputation in the immeasurable currency that every Fixer gathers, and too many failures can leave one in debt in this regard.

Generally speaking, all jobs fall into these primary categories:

# Bounty

The most common type of job is a bounty. These jobs often involve slaying a targeted beast or exterminating a den of beasts that are causing mayhem in or around a settlement. On rare occasions, these jobs can include tracking down and dispatching or capturing evildoers, gangs of thieves, malicious wizards or even thwarting the plans of [[Demigods]].

Of all the job types, these are the most straightforward, and are the most suitable for those new to the profession. In particularly rugged settlements deep in the wilderness, these jobs are often found in abundance.

While it may be tempting for Fixers to take the highest value job on the board, they should also understand that with higher risk comes the higher reward. Greed has tempted many such souls to an early grave. Depending on the target, bounty jobs can range from paltry sums to a king's ransom, so bounty listings tend to be the most varied in terms of payout. Wise Fixers use the payout as a measure of the danger the job will face.

Bounty jobs are best taken by Fixers with a proficiency in tracking, those who have exceptional strength and those who can't be swayed by pleas of surrender or claims of innocence. Often there is a condition for completion that the Fixer returns with a captive, a corpse or some other measure of proof to show that job has been properly handled.

# Mystery

Oftentimes a mystery posting is an attempt to pre-emptively dispatch an evil before it can take root in the area; other times it is an attempt to get to the core of an uncanny problem that can't be solved by typical means. This can range from investigating screams heard every night under a full moon from the top of an abandoned tower to finding the missing corpse of a recently deceased clergy. 

Jobs in this category often lead Fixers on unexpected adventures; sometimes bringing them to an unexpected treasure, or deep into the den of a terrifying foe. Fixers with a clinical mind, those who are good with puzzles or intrigue and adventurers with a sense of wonder love to come across mystery postings. These typically require more brainpower than physical strength.

Rewards for mystery postings vary greatly, as these jobs are often posted before danger is established. As such, it isn't uncommon to take a mystery posting that amounts to little more than a paranoid villager's imagination.

# Rumor

When a settlement is suffering a calamity, sometimes there is little in terms of a solution outside a rumor. Rumors are posted when villagers are desperate for help, but don't have much to offer in terms of guidance for a Fixer to investigate. Because these jobs are often a gamble for the poster and for the one who takes the job, they typically have the lowest payout; however it is not unheard of for these rumors to lead to unexpected gains.

Because of the potential for these jobs to have a minor payout, they are often left for amateurs and novices, or for savvy Fixers that either like to gamble on an unforeseen treasure. Altruistic Fixers, rare as they are, often love to accept Rumor listings, as a fruitful rumor, payment aside, can often lead to a vast improvement to the quality of life for the settlement it is posted in.

These jobs are a great opportunity for those new to the profession to cut their teeth, but one should be prepared because sometimes rumors lead to great and powerful evils. Many have embarked on simple rumors and never returned.
