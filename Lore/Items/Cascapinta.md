**Cascapinta** is a vivid, luminous blue pigment derived from the iridescent shells of the rare [[Azurisco]]. The process of extracting and refining the dye is a closely guarded secret—an art passed down through generations of Coelbren artisans who first pioneered the technique.

The striking hue of Cascapinta has become inseparable from the identity of [[Porto Coelbren]], the city where it is exclusively produced. It colors the woven textiles of local markets, the painted accents of seaside homes, and even finds its way into the city’s cuisine—tinting confections, liqueurs, and ceremonial dishes with its signature brilliance. More than a dye, Cascapinta is a cultural emblem: a symbol of tradition, craftsmanship, and coastal pride.

Aside from its striking hue, Cascapinta is prized for its exceptional durability. Unlike many natural dyes, it resists fading, bleaching, and weathering—even under the harsh sun and salty winds of the coast. Once applied, it bonds seamlessly to nearly any fabric or surface, from sailcloth and silk to wood, plaster, and stone.

This resilience has only deepened its value across the region, making it not just a symbol of beauty, but one of quality and permanence—an enduring testament to the mastery of Porto Coelbren’s artisans.

# Production

Divers collect discarded or molted Azurisco shells where possible, minimizing harm to live specimens. However, in rare cases—particularly for deep hues—artisans may use the shells of mature, naturally deceased Azurisco. The shell is carefully cleaned of organic residue, often using seawater and fermented lime vinegar.

The cleaned shells are laid out under the coastal sun for several days. This process is believed to “set” the inner glow of the pigment. The shells slowly shift from iridescent blue-green to a more concentrated, cobalt hue. Some artisans say the wind and salt in the air affect the vibrancy - making Porto Coelbren the only place where true Cascapinta can be cured.

Once cured, the brittle shells are crushed using stone mortars or alchemical mills into a fine blue powder. This stage is labor-intensive, and the powder must be sifted multiple times to remove impurities and achieve an even grain. The powder is then mixed with a binding agent - typically a combination of fermented seaweed resin, fig milk, and a few secret additions passed down in each dye-master’s family. This mixture is allowed to ferment in sealed clay vats for a full lunar cycle. During this time, it thickens into a paste or concentrate.

The fermented paste is reworked with either alum salts, lime ash, or an unknown stabilizer known only to the dye-guild. This “fixing” process gives Cascapinta its legendary resistance to fading and allows it to bond tightly to textiles, plaster, and wood. Once stabilized, Cascapinta is either dried into pigment cakes for painters or kept moist in sealed ceramic jars for dyers. It can be rehydrated or diluted without losing its potency, which is part of its great value.

Some master artisans believe the shells must be crushed only under moonlight to preserve the "spirit of the sea." Failed batches may still produce usable pigments—but lack the signature brilliance and permanence, so buyers are always advised to ensure that jars of Cascapinta bear the official seal from the [[Royal Merchant's Guild]] bearing the mark of the Azurisco Claw.
