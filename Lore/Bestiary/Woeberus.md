Woeberus was a [[Kappa]] born of the waters of the [[Silhit]] spring, as such, he spent his life protecting the river that extends from the spring, and the [[Naiad]] the occupies it.

During his long life, Woeberus became covetous of Silhit, and took her preference for other lovers to be a direct insult. As such, he took note of every transgression, twisting his jealousy into a motive to halt the flow of the waters. To do so, he hired a group of aquatic carpenters to build a dam at the source of the water.

This dam nearly suffocated the life of the spring, and the speed at which it dried up caused some alarmed villagers to post a [[Spring Cleaning|listing]] on the local [[Job Board]], causing the [[AAA Fixers For You]] to investigate the source of the waters. Once his scheme was exposed, the Fixers slayed the kappa, freeing the Naiad to come back to life.
