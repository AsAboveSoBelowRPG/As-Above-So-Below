The Azurisco is a rare and striking crustacean found only in the warm, tranquil waters of the [[Abismo de Março]]. Though its flesh is bitter and widely considered inedible, the creature is prized for its shimmering, iridescent blue shell—used in the creation of [[Cascapinta]], a deep, luminous pigment central to the dyes and paints of [[Coelbren (Region)|Coelbren]].

From birth, the Azurisco is remarkable in size: hatchlings emerge roughly the size of a grown human’s palm. Over its long and mysterious lifespan, the creature grows exponentially. Some of the oldest known specimens—believed to be several centuries old—have reached proportions rivaling a large cow.

Harvesting Azurisco is a delicate and dangerous undertaking. Not only must gatherers tread lightly to avoid damaging the fragile gulf ecosystem, but the crustaceans themselves are fiercely territorial. Their claws, both powerful and razor-sharp, are capable of severing a limb with ease. For this reason, only the most skilled and cautious divers are entrusted with the task—many bearing the scars of the job as proof of their trade.

# Cascapinta

The Azurisco is harvested primarily for its brilliant shell, which is processed into a rare pigment known as [[Cascapinta]]. This deep, iridescent blue is used in both dyes and paints, and is the signature hue that lends [[Porto Coelbren]] its distinctive, ocean-kissed palette.

The method of producing Cascapinta remains a closely guarded secret—passed down through generations of Coelbren artisans. Because the technique is known only within the city’s workshops, the pigment commands extraordinary value across the region, both as a luxury good and a symbol of Coelbren’s cultural identity.

# Ecological Concerns

Because Azurisco take centuries to reach full maturity—and are found only in the protected waters of the Março Gulf — concerns have grown over the long-term sustainability of their harvesting. Scholars from the University of [[Quatrograde]] have conducted extensive studies on the crustacean’s habitat and life cycle, warning that unchecked collection could drive the species to extinction.

Despite these warnings, gatherers and trade guilds insist that Azurisco populations remain plentiful. They dismiss the scholars’ concerns as alarmist, pointing to the consistency of seasonal yields and long-standing traditional methods as evidence that the species is in no immediate danger. Still, quiet debates simmer in academic circles and among coastal communities, where some believe the sea may not sustain such bounty forever.
