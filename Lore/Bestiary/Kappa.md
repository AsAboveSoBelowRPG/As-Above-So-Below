Kappa are aquatic beings that are generally looked on favorably, as they act as caretakers for the bodies of water they are attached to, however, their attitude can quickly sour when they feel they're being disrespected or slighted in some way.

Though they vary in size and appearance, most kappa range between the size of a dog and that of a child. They are humanoid in structure, but have a reptilian countenance, typically resembling a turtle. They have protective shells, sharp beaks and webbed fingers and toes which make them especially graceful in water, but clumsy and awkward on land. Particularly ancient Kappa, like [[Woeberus]] in [[Moradu]], can grow to enormous sizes.

Kappa do not have limited lifespans, and, when they are unchallenged by environmental dangers, will live indefinitely. That said, Kappa must stay close to their ancestral waters at all times, lest they dry up and perish. For this weakness, Kappa have an indentation in their heads where they carry water when they have to leave whichever body of water they reside in. This indentation is also the weakest spot on a Kappa's carapace.

Typically docile, kappa are content to tend to their ancestral waters. Where a water deity is present, such as a [[Naiad]], [[Nymph]] or [[Nereid]], the kappa takes a position of reverence and often takes orders directly from the host of the water. When the water deity is petty or ill-tempered, they often use these kappa as an extension of their wrath, which, historically, has given them a reputation as violent and cruel monsters.
