The Grimpa Gloompa are a horrible lineage of Cthonic dwarves that are bound eternally as servants of the dreaded ship of the damned, [[O Nazerack Expresso]]. There, they stalk the narrow hallways and cause mischief - mocking those who lose their purpose before they can disembark.

Though the Grimpa Gloompa are cursed to serve as the staff of the ship of the damned, they remain largely unhelpful and oftentimes downright disruptive. Their proclivity to break into mocking song and dance at the expense of others' misfortunes does little but cause deep grief for the suffering.

No one knows what caused these ancient beings to be bound to the ship of the damned, and even they seem unaware of what sin brought them to this unpleasant fate.
