Located in the Dockside neighborhood of [[Porto Coelbren]], The Weaveworks is a massive factory that deals with the needs of nautical vessels and sea trade. Anything to do with fabrics or fibers can be commissioned from the weaveworks - sailcloth, ropes, nets, uniforms or flags.

One of the longest-running establishments in Coelbren, the Weaveworks has endured for seven generations—surviving even the brutal conflict between [[Gharve]] and [[Umayyad]]. Its current owner, [[Max Orelha]], made his fortune outfitting naval vessels through lucrative government contracts. Now, with war in the past and prosperity rising, he’s setting his sights on a new frontier: tailoring for the city’s growing merchant class, whose wealth and ambition are reshaping Coelbren’s streets.

Because The Weaveworks services so many different facets of the textile arts, it employs a diverse cadre of skilled artisans. Each master oversees a team of apprentices and specialists within their craft, creating a workshop that hums like a loom in motion: coordinated, layered, and always producing. This structure not only ensures efficiency but fosters innovation, as techniques and traditions blend across disciplines under one roof.

# Cascapinta Dyeing

Though historical evidence suggests that [[Azurisco]] shells have been used to produce the vivid blue dye emblematic of Coelbren artistry for centuries—perhaps even as far back as the Second Age—the Orelha family insists the process was a modern invention of their Weaveworks artisans.

Locals, well aware of the dye’s deeper roots, largely dismiss the claim as self-serving mythmaking. But outsiders, enchanted by the story and the prestige of the Weaveworks name, often accept it at face value—believing the brilliant pigment to be the product of recent innovation rather than ancient tradition.

Even still, the Weaveworks does employ a dyemaster from a prestigious family of [[Cascapinta]] artistans - [[Atalina de Fonte]].
