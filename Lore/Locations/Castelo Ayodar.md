Castelo Ayodar was the ancestral home of the Ayodar Family; a renowned clan of gifted magicians and oracles. Serving in positions of power and high esteem, even during [[The Common Light]], the family lineage predates known history; as does the construction of the ancestral keep. 

It was said to have been located deep in the [[Kasmanium Range]], near the current location of the settlement of [[Moradu]] in the [[Lordless Lands]] of [[Gallacão]]. Despite being referenced in a number of works of the early days of The Third Age, archeologists and cartographers have yet to find even a ruin to support its existence.

Since the Ayodar Bloodline seemed to have vanished sometime in the early days of the Third Age, many scholars dismiss the entire family as little more than heroic characters invented by creative writers of the past.

# Destruction of Castle Ayodar

One theory as to the possible wholesale disappearance of the castle involves another mythical being - the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial]] [[Nazerack]]. Sources tell of a struggle between the demigod [[Zyweith the Hollow]] and the leader of the [[Ordem Etérea]], [[Afonso Roche]] that was said to have taken place in Ayodar.

During this confrontation, the Necromancer Zyweith is said to have summoned the Primordial God. Nazerack is reported to have been so large that when it descended from the heavens, it completely blocked the sun from the sky and turned the day to night. Thus summoned, the being descended to the surface of [[Amalthea]] and completely devoured the castle and left a huge pit as it tunneled deep into the [[Cthonic Remains]].

The unstable cliffs around this pit eventually collapsed, covering the enormous tunnel, and a lake collected in the crater. If true, this would explain why there has been little evidence of this great structure.
