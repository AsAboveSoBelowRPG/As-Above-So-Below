The Lone Crow is an old [[Caravel]] sailing the trade routes in the [[Abismo de Março]]. The ship is captained by a young sailor from [[Porto Coelbren]] named [[Odilon Cruz]] using an initiative established by [[The Council of Six]] to help locals establish larger commercial enterprises. Despite being deeply warn and weathered, the crew is extremely proud of their vessel and see it as an opportunity to attain a better life.

# History

The ship was initially built in the year 3'924 in [[Porto Cyii]] and christened the Frigate Lumar. In the early years it was used to supply food to the royal city [[Salasandra]] during wartime. Its ability to navigate both rivers and coastal waters made it invaluable during sieges of the capital. 

After the frigate was retired from royal service, it was purchased by a tea merchant from [[Gorreana]] looking to expand his reach. Unfortunately, the merchant lost the ship in a high-stakes dice game to a degenerate smuggled named [[Zayaat the Red]]. Though the ship often sustained heavy damage fleeing naval vessels, it served successfully in smuggling endeavors for a syndicate called the [[Beco Nascido]]. During this period the vessel was renamed "O Velório".

# Seizure

The ship was boarded in port at [[Faraon]] after operations of the Beco were discovered by the [[Umayyad]] Navy. Several tonnes of contraband were confiscated from the hold of the ship, and the crew was arrested and sentenced for their crimes of smuggling. As happens with ships seized by the government, it was put up for auction, where the [[The Council of Six]] fronted the cost to fund the enterprise of a young captain from the city of [[Porto Coelbren]]. 

# New Legacy

The captain of the shipping venture, [[Odilon Cruz]], renamed the vessel "The Lone Crow", and filed papers for the ship to sail under this name for the purposes of legitimate trade between the cities of [[Porto Coelbren]] and [[Faraon]]. The inaugural voyage was made in 3'1045 with a full hold of passengers and cargo.
