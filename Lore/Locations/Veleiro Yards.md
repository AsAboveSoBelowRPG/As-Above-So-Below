The Veleiro Yards stand as one of the crown jewels of maritime industry in Porto Coelbren - a sprawling, salt-stained shipyard renowned across the coast for its craftsmanship, precision, and uncompromising work ethic. From sleek merchant clippers to broad-decked naval vessels, ships of every make are bought, sold, and commissioned here under the discerning eye of master shipwrights.

More than just a marketplace, the Yards offer full repair and refitting services, with drydocks large enough to cradle even the oldest three-masters. Crews work day and night beneath towering gantries and fluttering banners, their movements orchestrated with clockwork efficiency. Reputation is everything in Porto Coelbren, and the name _Veleiro_ carries weight in every port where blue [[Cascapinta]] paint touches the hull.
