The Anlaith are a violent group of dissident elves from the settlement of [[Anduantas]] that reject the Gods of Light in favor of the deceitful Primordials. The faction was founded by a former philosopher, Bréagach, who leads his followers into a fabricated darkness. After an attempted uprising, the terrorist was banished to the underworld, and his many followers opted to join him in this exile.

# Origins

Some say, in the early days of [[The Common Light]] when the [[Danu]] took power as the ruling [[Gods|pantheon]] in [[Amalthea]], the settlement of [[Anduantas]] was already thriving from the late days of darkness. This theory places the elves of [[An-Talamh]] as children of the [[Primordial Gods]], and claims that their allegiances should lie with the [[Cthonic Gods]], rather than the usurpers, the Danu.

Though a fringe theory, the appeal to the ancient roots of the Elven race spoke to the more radical among the ageless elves who lived in the holy north. When the philosopher [[Bréagach Droch-Cheann]] began to study the history of this doctrine, his views grew more and more radical; often proselytizing for the Primordials during public forums.

His obsession spread among the people and coalesced into the radical faction known as the Anlaith. Resigning from this position in the [[Hall of the Oracle]], Bréagach turned his full attention to insighting unrest among his constituency. This reached a fever pitch in 2'1996 when the Anlaith lead an failed insurrection against the Oracle, [[Méabh Daibhéid]]. His revolution was unsuccessful, in large part thanks to the powerful allies of House Daibhéid. As punishment for their violence and rejection of known facts in lieu of a fabricated reality, Bréagach and his Anlaith were banished to the [[Cthonic Remains]], where they were thought to have died out. 

# Resurgence

For millennia the Anlaith toiled quietly in the unseen world of the Cthonic realm, and with each passing decade the threat of the extremist sect seemed to weaken until the point where these worshipers of darkness seemed to be little more than myth.  This changed when a contingency of Anlaith scouts were captured in [[The Loathewood]], seeking for the entrance to the elvish village.

For years these scouting parties continued to seek entrance to the hidden village, but it wasn't until the abduction of [[Niamh Chéanna]], a young poet from Anduantas, that the violent revolutionaries were able to find their way into their former home. Leading a group of trained warriors against a peaceful culture that knew no violence, the Anlaith easily took control of the city, though they were unable to execute the Oracle, who had successfully fled the village before the raid.

Now in control of the Anduantas, the Anlaith sought to expand its influence into the nearby human kingdom of [[Gallacão]] by installing armed patrols and representatives in the surrounding areas, including the city of [[Moradu]]. This conflict unintentionally involved a group of mercenaries known as the [[AAA Fixers For You]] that had thwarted a number of Anlaith plots in the area of conflict.

Strangely enough, the leader of the Anlaith, [[Bréagach Droch-Cheann]], was not part of the raiding party and hasn't been seen above ground, save by one account from the [[Fixer]] band that claim to have been assaulted by a powerful elf claiming to be Bréagach outside their Moradu office. Since this moment he has been curiously absent from the civil war.

# Notable Members

Even before their exile to the underworld, the ranks of the Anlaith contained many dangerous and powerful individuals. Though many of these rebels were assumed to have succumbed to the perils of the Cthonic, they appear to have survived, if not grown stronger from the harsh conditions below ground. Some of these high-ranking individuals include:

- [[Bréagach Droch-Cheann]] - The leader of the Anlaith, and the only one under a forced banishment to the Cthonic realm.
- [[Tromán Sellis]] - Bréagach's best friend and most trusted advisor; Tromán's strength doesn't come from his physical attributes, but in his cunning and strategic mind.
- [[Aodhán Ó Dubhartaigh]] - The terrifying leader of the Anlaith Blackguard, Aodhán is easily the Anlaith's greatest warrior.
- [[Limgrave Aire]] - A cunning tracker, Limgrave was the one who unlocked Anduantas for invasion through his deplorable tactics.
- [[Teachta Dáithí ]] - As close to a diplomat as the Anlaith can muster, Dáithí was sent as an envoy to the human settlement of Moradu.
