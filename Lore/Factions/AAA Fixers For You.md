The AAA Fixers For You is a band of [[Fixer|Fixers]] that rose to prominence in the settlement of [[Moradu]] in the year of 3'2071. The band was added to the registry by the [[Gallacão]] Secretary of State [[Eurynomea Xanthippe]] at the Moradu Guild Hall.

The Triple-A Fixers first joined forces unofficially at the debut of the Moradu [[Job Board]]; an initiative from Alderman [[Gaspar Glumbo]] to restore the struggling village to its former glory. Their first job pitted them against the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic]] [[Dagdromen]], the deceitful God of Illusion. Facing such a danger on their first mission solidified their friendship and bound them together as a team.

Since then, the band has taken a number of job requests from the citizens of Moradu, which have brought a sense of renewed prosperity to the distant settlement. The Triple-A's have also been involved peripherally with the insurrection of the [[Anlaith]] against the High Oracle [[Méabh Daibhéid]] of the [[Anduantas]]. Thier unintentionally meddling with the plans of [[Bréagach Droch-Cheann]], the leader of the terrorists, has made them a target of his ire.

The band enlisted the aid of the carpenter [[Beck]] to construct a humble headquarters on the outskirts of Moradu, which serves as a center for their activity and a gathering point for the many members. Signs on the property clearly state that guests are unwelcome.

# Members

The ranks of the Triple-A's are still expanding, but the core of their membership includes a number of fledgling mercenaries with great potential.

- [[Bo Skaal]]; a travelling musician known for his unique energetic horn-centric tunes, Bo became the leader of the Triple-A's with unanimous support.
- [[Milo Terd]]; treasurer of the band, Milo is a young and seemingly naive wizard. Milo works hard to fit in despite his social shortcomings.
- [[Gordo Bloodfury]]; the quiet elf that never shows his true face, Gordo often waits patiently while the others bicker before solving the problem with brute force.
- [[Sebuh Kenku]]; though unable to communicate verbally, Sebuh is a brilliant machinist who is able to construct tools and automatons for combat and defense.
- [[Malork]]; A simple-minded warrior who follows the compass of his heart towards adventure. Never hesitates to put himself between a threat and those he cares about.
- [[Zimo the Cur]]; A shiftless mercenary who aided the Triple-A's during their early adventures, but was rumored to have gone into hiding from his abusive father.
- [[Saryn Inaros]]; the gentle and caring half-elf healer that offered his services to the band both in dealing with some of their early jobs, as well as contributing to the construction fund for their office.
- [[Timothée Dublichet]]; an arrogant and stubborn elf with a flair for cooking and picking fights in the most condescending manner.

# Notable Jobs

We can tell from guild records that the Triple-A's took a tremendous number of jobs during their tenure. The [[Ordem de Reparação]] records account for a majority of their sanctioned work, though jobs taken outside of the official means may be missing.

- **Bounty - [[The Arsonist]]**:  The first job taken by the band, long before they officially organized under the name of the Triple-A's. Contracted by a local blacksmith [[Helder Hall]] to surreptitiously retrieve an enchanted hammer from a fiend that destroyed his livelihood. 
- **Rumor - [[Spring Cleaning]]**: With the spring that had brought abundance and life to the mountain village drying up, some of the locals contracted the band to investigate the mournful cries coming from the spring at night, suspecting the two were connected.
- **Bounty - [[The Merry Trapaceiros]]**: The Triple-A's stood to gain a fortune for hunting down a group of brigands that had kidnapped a powerful noble. What appeared to be a cut-and-dry case of dispatching scoundrels turned into a tense standoff when they found out the brigands were beloved by the locals and the Baron was transporting alarming cargo in his wagon.
- **Bounty - [[The Red Hunter]]:** Two feuding noble houses put their differences aside when a forbidden affair brings death to roost. The surviving patriarchs call for the death of the legendary beast [[Nemia]] - The Red Hunter. Expecting to face a ferocious monster, the band was surprised to find themselves in the midst of a greater mystery.
- **Rumor - [[The Sting House]]:** The Merchant's Guild has been updating their maps of the [[Lordless Lands]], and the cartographer they sent to investigate Moradu needed the help of the Fixers to clear a den of thieves from a once prosperous hall.
- **Rumor - [[The Unfeeling Man]]:** Guilt over the sins of the settlement urge the mad reverend to enlist the aid of the Fixers to track down a peculiar man once exiled and bring him back to the fold.
- **Mystery - [[The Old Goat]]:** Agreeing to help the alderman track down his prized sacrifice for the [[Festa do Anastasis]] as the entire settlement prepares for the holy celebration.
- **Bounty - [[The Troll Toll]]:** Jakab Ginn of the Merchant's Guild contracted the Triple-A's to uproot a band of goblins that had taken hold of an old tollhouse on the [[Kasman Road]]. In their exploration of the nearby den, they find a devious troll to be pulling the strings.

# Rival Factions

Despite working tirelessly to improve life for the settlements they serve, the Triple-A's have managed to make a number of powerful enemies throughout their existence. Typically these are just petty thugs, though they have stepped on some powerful toes in the course of duty.

- The [[Broed Band]] - A rival faction of Fixers from the capital, these brutes were sent as a contingency to control the newly announced Job Board in Moradu. They set up camp near the other fixers, but were flooded out when [[Silhit]] was restored to her full strength.
- [[Os Pecadores]] - Encountered in the sewers beneath the Moradu Marketplace, this organization of thieves and thugs had set up a thriving business in human trafficking. The extent to which this group of villains extends is yet unknown.
- [[Anlaith]] - A dangerous group of elves who had been banished to the [[Cthonic Remains]] for their beliefs that staged a violent uprising against the settlement of [[Anduantas]].

# Allies

In the course of their work, the Triple-A's have helped a considerable number of people - some of which have powerful ties and connections. Some of these people have offered their skills and services, while others have actively aided in duty or battle.

- [[Gaspar Glumbo]] - The Alderman of the settlement of Moradu and perhaps the person who has benefitted most from the hard work of the Triple-A's.
- [[Beck]] - A nomadic fishman carpenter that found himself in the employ of a wicked Kappa, the Fixers instead brought him to the surface and helped him establish a thriving business.
- [[Fillipa Alyce]] - A half-dwarf archeologist that is seeking evidence to support the theories of her disgraced mentor. Her work leads her frequently into dangerous locations, which often puts her in the path of the Triple-A's.
- [[Jakab Ginn]] - Working as a cartographer from the Merchant's Guild, Jakab has spent many years surveying the old trade routes of the [[Lordless Lands]], often relying on the aid of the Fixers to clear obstacles.
- [[Nemia]] - Known in legends as a savage beast called *The Red Hunter*, in reality Nemia is a noble and intelligent being that serves as a protector to the High Oracle of Anduantas.
- [[Osna Chléibh]] - The satyr druid has long served the house of Daibhéid, fleeing with them during the Anlaith insurrection. Osna formed a tentative alliance with the Triple-A's to aid him in his charge.
