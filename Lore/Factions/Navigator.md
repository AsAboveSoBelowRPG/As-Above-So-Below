**Navigators** are a nomadic people that have spread through the [[Five Kingdoms of Man]], and are present in all corners of [[Amalthea]]. While it is contested as to where they originated, those that belong to the tribe insist that where they come from isn't as important as where they're going.

While Navigators feel a sense of identity that is defined by their untethered nationality, they also ascribe to no formal power structure, and travel in amorphous groups called "**Convoys**" - colorful wagon trains that group together to travel together permanently, or simply for a shared distance in the same direction.

# Traditions

Navigator life varies greatly depending on the convoy, though certain traditions are carried universally. These societal hallmarks are so steeped in tradition that many are believed to predate the current diaspora and have been a structural part of proto-Navigator life; in some cases, potentially even giving rise to the culture as a whole.

## Vagabundear

The principal trial in the life of the Navigator is the Vagabundear, a coming-of-age ritual in which, at the age of fifteen, the participant enters a period of exile. During Vagabundear, the Navigator leaves their home convoy to make their own way in the world. While there are no rules dictating what the emancipated wanderer must do with their time, it is essential for every Navigator to be able to survive in the world without any support, and thus must voluntarily walk independently for some time.

While some end up seeking out their familial convoy, other end up joining new groups or even starting their own. Some even take to a sedentary life and start families in settlements - like everything in the life of a Navigator, one is free to walk the path that calls to them.

## Grande Libertação

It is not uncommon for Navigator convoys to set up long-term camps from between 1-3 years. These camps are never permanent, though, and when the time comes to pull up stakes and return to the road, Navigators always honor the land that hosted them in the same way that you would honor one who welcomed you into their home.

This ritual typically takes place over a number of weeks and is always performed whenever a convoy has spent over a full cycle in one place. As perpetual guests in the world, Navigators view their stewardship of shared spaces as a sacred duty and, therefore, always intend to leave their camps better off than they found them. This often includes the planting of fruit trees, cleaning of debris, the construction of shrines and improvements to roads, paths and signage in the area. These civic projects are often initiated as soon as the convoy decides to make camp.

This ritual is punctuated by a great feast, in which the head of the table is left vacant, with the largest portions served to the land, as if they are inviting the land to be their guest. Any travelers that happen upon a Navigator camp on the night of a Libertação are treated to exceptional hospitality.

## Sharing of Names

As a nomadic people, carrying a lineage is difficult. The Navigators have long carried an artisanal tradition of weaving names into small strings of beads, which are hung from the frames of the family caravan. As a way to share their lineage, it is Navigator custom to invite those from other convoys into their home to share their heritage with those from other convoys. This is always done with a special spiced cake and strong ale.
