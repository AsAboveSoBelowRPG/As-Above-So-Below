A Reparadore, or as they're more commonly known, a **Fixer**, is a type of freelance mercenary that deals with the problems of a community, often related to beasts, monsters or even esoteric threats. These professionals are registered with a central guild and often form or join bands to work together with others in their profession, however it is possible to perform Fixer work as a loner - much like the legendary Fixer, [[Geraldo De Rossio]], O Raposa Blanco.

# Origins

Fixers first start to appear in literature around the start of the Third Age as a sort of colloquialism for monster hunters that solve or 'fix' the problems of a village. This tradition, however, traces its origin back to [[The Common Light]] with the fabled [[Ordem Etérea]], a group of knights committed to purging the terrestrial world of the remnants of the [[Luxomachy]]. These knights, which were based out of [[Castellón de la Aragão]], spread out across the land, stalking and dispatching evils associated with the [[Smoladh]], the lord of darkness.

After the [[Treaty of Oisín]] banished the elder races, the order disbanded and retreated to [[An-Talamh]], however, the need for roving protectors to patrol the land remained. A number of members of the order were humans and so remained after the banishment. These people took up the task of hunting monsters and protecting civilization, yet, without an organization to provide for their needs, these services began to come with a cost.

# Guilds and Bands

By 3'209, after a number of brigands started usurping the title of 'Fixer' to swindle distant villages of easy money, a formal guild was established to license and police those who seek to take work from a [[Job Board]].  As such, the [[Ordem de Reparação]] was founded and serves as the overseeing entity.

Many Fixers prefer to work alone, or informally partner with others to take on more dangerous jobs, though others find it safer and more advantageous to form or join a Band. Bands are formally registered with the Order through a number of guild halls or envoys. In many larger cities, the job boards are dominated by larger bands, who unofficially parcel out jobs to those who join their ranks. For instance, the [[Broed Band]] of [[Salasandra]] has a firm grip on the job boards of the Royal City and many of its surrounding villages, forcing independent Fixers to seek work further and further in the wilderness.

# Finding Work

As it has been from the start, Fixers find work by consulting the Job Board in a village. Typically jobs are posted by a chief, village elder, alderman or a clerk from the ruling nobility of the area; posting made in major population centers are often made directly by the guild office in that city. Posting that haven't come through official channels tend to be removed, as to prevent Fixers from being lured into an ambush, or from taking a job for which the poster has no intention of paying. 

In larger cities where a plethora of jobs are on offer, it is common practice for the Order to collect a deposit up front to ensure the work is paid for. In cases where the poster skips on the rest of the promised sum,  the order has a branch of enforcers entirely for the purpose of collecting what is owed. These debt collectors, [[Recompensa|The Recompensa]], are renowned for their brutal means and methods for extracting owed payments.

Reparadores that are unaffiliated with one of the larger bands often have to seek work further into the rural wilderness of Amalthea where the influence of the larger bands has yet to reach. Luckily, these dangerous areas are rarely low on work, though the wages are often considerably lower. Often, novice Fixers will go to the distant settlements to build experience and a reputation, sometimes gather with other peers and form a  band, then return to the major population centers when they have more influence.

# Reception

A far cry from the welcomes seen by the honorable [[Ordem Etérea]], when a Fixer comes to town there is often a mixed reception. While typically seen as a necessary evil, they are often considered to be uncivilized, greedy ruffians. As such, young Fixers often end up pitching camps outside of towns until they've earned a proper welcome and developed trust among the citizens.

If, however, a Fixer has attained a heroic status, much like the legendary [[Geraldo De Rossio|White Fox, Geraldo]], there is often more fanfare. Being able to say your town was purged of darkness by a famous Fixer contributes greatly to the reputation of village and often creates a prosperity by drawing visitors and new settlers to the area. As such, these legendary Fixers demand a small fortune for their work.
