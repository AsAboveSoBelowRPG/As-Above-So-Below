The Glumbo family settled the [[Serra da Verra Alto]] in northern [[Gallacão]] for countless generations.  In the year 3'1462, Harbin Glumbo founded a small settlement among the ruins of the [[Castelo Corajoso]]. 

The town registry of [[Moradu]] details a lineage of Glumbos that goes back 10 generations; where they came from before that time is unknown, but most of the settlers in the [[Lordless Lands]] came from southern [[Gallacão]], either fleeing war or looking to strike a fortune mining for precious metals in the [[Kasmanium Range]].  Based on his ability and resources to establish a thriving settlement in an inhospitable land, it is believed that Harbin had the backing of an influential benefactor and prior experience in a leadership position.

Since Harbin's establishment of Moradu, there has always been a member of Clan Glumbo serving as the elected leader of the settlement.

# Lineage

Harbin Glumbo, who settled Moradu, had a single son named Brau who also had a single son named Jole. Jole married the daughter of Eronaite Andador, Elyna. This marriage consolidated power in the Lordless Lands, and is considered to be a political union. Records show that Moradu was on the brink of collapse before this marriage was arranged.

Jole and Elyna gave birth to a single son, [[Gaspar the Elder|Gaspar]]. Gaspar begat two daughters, Bonna and Grale, and two sons, Coule and Brushao. It was the youngest, Brushao, who carried the leadership role and furthered the bloodline with the birth of a daughter, Sou, who was born a gifted oracle, and Egídio. Foley and Unar were the sons of Egídio, and his only daughter was Delline, who was a stout warrior and vied for leadership against her brother, though Foley won the election, making Delline the sheriff. 

Foley wed a mystic from [[Galego]] named Estefânia Medeiros, and the two had three sons and a daughter; Cruz, Abel, Goren and Stella. It was during this generation that we see the decline of Moradu; a trend that would continue into the modern era. Cruz also had four children; Alwynn, Aspix, Weston and his only daughter Basta. 

Weston had two children, [[Gaspar Glumbo|Gaspar]] and [[Donilo Glumbo|Donilo]]. While Gaspar was beloved for his kind heart and simple mind, Donilo was the one groomed for leadership. Though beloved by the people of Moradu, he died young, having only an infant daughter, [[Kamilla Glumbo|Kamilla]] with his wife Ana Ashewhite, both who moved away from Moradu after the death of Donilo. Without an heir, the people of Moradu instead turned to the slow and kind Gaspar to lead the village.  As of the recording of this lineage, Gaspar has no children.

While this is the most complete lineage we have of Clan Glumbo, it must be noted that it primarily chronicles that of the sibling that held political power in Moradu. Perhaps only those in power had children, though this seems highly unlikely. As this record was compiled largely through official documents regarding the leadership of the settlement, we have a very specific lineage.
