Lead by the charismatic rogue [[Farooq Masquat]], this band of petty thieves haunt the woods along the length of the roads through the [[Kasmanium Range]]. Always certain to provide something they deem a value equal to what they take - whether a haunting ballad from Slick Philburt, a hearty tankard of ale from the brewer Dalmond Dozer, or a feast among the whole crew - this group has a strong moral code by which it always navigates.

The gang is always easily identifiable by their characteristic clothing in the color of Lincoln green and tan. Each member is issued two bolts of cloth in these colors each year, which they are free to fashion into outfits that best suit their style. The colors were carefully chosen to help the members best blend in with the scenery of the surrounding woodlands.

# Membership

The ever-shifting membership currently includes seven able bodies. Members of this band are free to explore any life they choose, and they always welcome like-minded people to join.

- [[Farooq Masquat]] - The charismatic leader that founded the Trapaceiros in protest to wealth inequality in [[Gallac達o]].
- [[Portly Jo達o]] - Farooq's right hand, Jo達o is a hulking Orc of immeasurable physical strength, but very little mental acuity.
- [[Prinja Fernplume]] - An Elven druid, said to be an exile from nearby [[Salasandra]]. Prinja is very tied to the customs of her people.
- [[Dixon Votario]] - A common thief that fled into the Loathewood to seek shelter from the law. Happened upon the Trapaceiros which he happily joined.
- [[Slick Philburt|Slick Philburt the Bard]] - A handsome young man with unrivaled musical gifts.
- [[Brando]] - The most mysterious member of the gang who has never revealed his face, which he hides behind a black iron mask.
- [[Dalmond Dozer]] - A talented dwarven brewer that received the kindness of the Trapaceiros during a period of difficulty and decided to join their carefree life.

# Baron Matrim

During the ambush of a royal caravan, the Trapaceiros uncovered a troubling plot, in which a member of the Salasandra nobility, [[Matrim Elfonce]], was kidnapping and feeding on children from the northern realms. Uncertain how to handle this revelation, they brought the noble back to their camp. While deliberating the consequences, the [[AAA Fixers For You]] were contracted to apprehend the gang.

Instead, the Fixers assisted in exposing the true form of the monstrous baron and allowed the Trapaceiros to attempt to clear their name by turning themselves in to the Royal Court in [[Salasandra]]. Unfortunately, the corpse of the monster wasn't proof enough to exonerate the gang, and they were all imprisoned and sentenced to death.
