The Council of Six is the committee that governs the [[Coelbren (Region)|District of Coelbren]]. As the name implies, it consists of six members which are appointed by the citizens of the region. The Council was first assembled in 3'1042 to replace the military leadership of the Warden that ruled during the war with [[Umayyad]], a Holy Knight named [[Marcelino Barbosa]].

# Members

While there are no determined term lengths, members serve as long as they have the support of the community. The current membership includes:

- [[Eirenē Ávila]]: Even during the rule of the Warden, nothing was law until Eirenē acknowledged it. The oldest and most respected member of the council, she earned her seat easily.
- [[Abdeslam Al-Walid]]: Though a native of [[Porto Coelbren]], Abdeslam spent most of the war overseeing his shipping interest in [[Faraon]]. When he returned to his home after the treaty, he was immediately nominated by the Merchant's Guild to serve on the council.
- [[Fausto Carreira]]: Military minded, Fausto is the captain of the Town Guard. Though not particularly beloved by the people of Coelbren, he was nominated by Warden Barbosa when he turned down a seat on the council himself.
- [[Esparatz Lima]]: The youngest member of the council, Esparatz is a local woman who speaks on behalf of the city's poor, and is beloved by the people for her defense of the locals who are increasingly oppressed by the deluge of wealthy inhabitants.
- [[Aldo Silvas]]: A local merchant who made a fortune during the war smuggling rarities out of [[Umayyad]] into Coelbren. Since the war ended he has used his wealth to establish a legitimate trade fleet.
- [[Muhsina Idrissi]]: The High Priestess of the Cult of [[Slint]], the patron deity of Coelbren. Though she is rarely seen in the city, her voice carries great weight among the devout of the region.

# Duties

The Council of Six is tasked with ushering Coelbren from being a humble frontier region into a wealthy and prosperous port of call for merchants and traders from all over [[Amalthea]]. Though the transition has been particularly challenging to the locals, who are quickly being forced from their homes due to the economic inequalities, the council works tirelessly to balance the issues plaguing the population while simultaneously encouraging growth.

To this effect, each member of the council offers a unique perspective on how best to support the region - viewpoints of security, poverty, wealth and piety are all represented on the council. In the three years since it was formed, the group has accomplished a great deal.

# Initiatives

Though each council member has a number of special projects they wish to employ, the current talk of the town is the Loan Scheme, proposed Councilor Esparatz, which created a fund to give loans to poor locals that wish to elevate themselves into the merchant class. Though it had the support of Councilor Eirene, she leveled a criticism that it supports the elitist viewpoint that everyone should aspire to be a rich merchant, when there is nothing wrong with being a humble fisherman.

This Loan Scheme was first awarded to a young fisherman by the name of [[Odilon Cruz]], who sought the funds to purchase a seized smuggling vessel from the [[Umayyad]] government to be used as a transportation vessel between [[Faraon]] and [[Porto Coelbren]]. Esparatz was first to book passage on the ship, as a sign of faith from the Council.
