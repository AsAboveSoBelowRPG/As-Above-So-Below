The Flame Stompers are a unique touring band that formed in [[Luavila]] around 3'2010 by a small group of [[Fixer]]s that were registered under the same name. Their sound is challenging to describe, as they pioneered their unique style. Their songs are defined by energetic music featuring a large horn section and unconventional vocals with a largely positive vibe.

This unique form of music was said to have grown from the founder, [[Byron Lee]]'s personal sound aesthetic, but in interviews he rejected the idea that he was the sole architect of the bands sound, instead insisting that it was a collaborative project and everyone contributed their soul to the unique sound.

Few travelling bands achieve the renown that The Flame Stompers attained before they disbanded. In their tenure as a band, The Flame Stompers played more than 2,500 shows across the [[Five Kingdoms of Man]], especially [[Iberys]] and [[Gallacão]] where most of the band members hailed from. As such, no contemporary artist, save for maybe [[Portia Do Dia]], has ever attained such widespread fame across [[Amalthea]].

# Origins of Ska Music

When asked what genre of music The Flame Stompers played, the members of the band have always responded with the term "Ska Music", which has become the catch-all term for music that captures the same mood and elements of the songs performed by The Flame Stompers. Ska is defined by its frantic pace, its off-beat rhythms and its heavy employment of a large horn section.

There are many myths and theories as to where this term came from, but the most popular claims the term was coined when an excited patron asked what kind of music the band was playing. During that moment, the trumpet player [[Bo Skaal]] was in the middle of a solo, so the band leader Byron shouted "This is Skaal music," which the patron misinterpreted as "Ska music." While plausible, this explanation is most likely a myth that took root in the wake of the band breaking up.

Either way, the genre of Ska music is credited to The Flame Stompers and remains a musical curiosity, with a number of the musicians going on to form other bands with the same sonic qualities.

# Notable Members

During the nearly 60 years of playing together, The Flame Stompers welcomed a large number of collaborators - some who played together for only a few shows and others who became long term members. Of these many members, the 'core' of the band is largely considered to be made of [[Byron Lee]], [[Dude Coxstone]], [[Coal Stranger]], [[King Busto]] and [[Big Duke Wompus]], who started together as a band of Fixers under the same name. Slowly their musical endeavors began to overshadow their work as members of the order.

Other favorites include [[Coyne Altomaca]], [[Jerome Garfo]], [[Torelle Andar]], [[Hot Pedro]], [[Papa Don]] and [[Bo Skaal]], who is the spiritual successor to the Flame Stomper's distinct sound.

# Disbanding

Though the band continued to play well into the old age of the initial members - in some cases, even outliving a number of the core members like Jerome and Torelle. Well past his prime, Byron made the heavy decision to retire from performing. The band attempted to go on without him, but without his charisma and name recognition, The Flame Stompers eventually made the choice to split up.

Hot Pedro started a band called "The Red Hot Padrón Peppers" and Coyne's splinter group retained part of the name with his band "The Flaming Lábios". Bo reportedly decided to take a hiatus from music to do some Fixer work, though his return to the stage is highly anticipated.
