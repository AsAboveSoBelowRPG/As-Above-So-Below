The Ordem de Reparação is the guild that oversees the licensing and conduct of the mercenaries known as Reparadores, or colloquially as [[Fixer|Fixers]]. Though members of this guild tend to be scattered and disparate, it became necessary to formalize a guild to protect the reputations of the profession after common thugs started masquerading as Fixers to swindle villages out of bounties.

Work is distributed to members of the Order through posting on village [[Job Board|Job Boards]].

# History

The occupation of serving small villages beset by beings of darkness has existed since the dawn of [[The Common Light]], when remnants of the legions of the [[Primordial Gods]] still haunted the lands in great numbers. At the time, brave heroes would wander the lands rooting out derelicts from the [[Time of Chaos]].

Eventually these nomadic warriors gathered to form the [[Ordem Etérea]]. For tens of thousands of years, this order worked tirelessly to purge the land of evil, offering their services without cost or expectation. As such, these knights were beloved by the people of [[Amalthea]], and were often treated to great feasts and preferential lodging without the need for an exchange of currency or favor.

After the [[Treaty of Oisín]] cast the [[Tuatha]] out of Amalthea, the order disbanded, leaving the continent at the mercy of the mounting evils. The human members of the order did their best to maintain the organization, but without the senior members, they were unable to support the needs of the ravaged land. The last member of the Ordem Etérea died in 3'071, which brought about the end of the organization.

Without the consistent aid of benevolent knights, the outer settlements began to suffer from frequent assault by monsters and demigods. In desperation, the people of these besieged towns gathered what they could spare and posted bounties for their problematic tormentors on boards outside the villages. Within time, capable warriors began to patrol these distant settlements in search of paid work. Whenever these nomadic mercenaries would finish a contract, they were said to have 'fixed' the issue, or to have 'repaired' the status of the village. Within time these people became known as Reparadores, or more casually, as Fixers.

No formal order existed between these professionals for over a hundred years, but as more people took advantage of the reputation of these capable fighters in order to swindle poor townfolk of their deposits - with some particularly despicable brigands even working together to create false hauntings, then offering to fix the fake issue for a princely sum. To protect their dignity and their professions, the most capable of the Reparadores gathered together and founded the Ordem de Reparação, much like the same as the Ordem Etérea did at the dawn of the Second Age, in [[Castellón de la Ayodar]].

# Notable Members

Though the Order doesn't enjoy the same prestige as its predecessor, it has still produced a number of valiant heroes known far and wide in song and story. For instance, every citizen of a distant or rural settlement knows at least one story of [[Geraldo De Rossio]].
