The First Age, the dawn of time, is often referred to as the Time of Chaos. This era existed so inconceivably long before recorded history that very little of this time even exists in mythology.

What is known from stories that survived through [[The Common Light]] regard the creation of the realms of [[Amalthea]] and the birth of the first [[Gods]]. According to these myths, before time began, everything existed as one; there was no distinction between what was and what wasn't. This was called the [[Divine Unity]]; a state in which everything existed, yet nothing did.

# Creation Myth

This period was said to have never existed, yet simultaneously existed for eternity. It is said that the Divine Unity was shattered by the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial]] [[Xadul]], who defined himself and, in that moment created a division between the whole. The Unity wasn't able to sustain its existence within a realm where something was 'Xadul or not Xadul', and in that moment the Unity shattered, scattering and expanding as everything it contained quickly differentiated itself from those that it was not.

As the Unity exploded, it created several realms and populated them with the shards of divinity is shed. In the material plane, it created the world, and Amalthea, and the cavernous spaces below that bridged the gap to the ethereal plane of darkness. Above this it created the realm of the sky and then beyond even that it continued to spread, leaving behind the [[Celestials]] who inhabit these distant realms, still.

# Rule of Darkness

The Time of Chaos was true in every sense; among those Gods who suddenly came to be there was great confusion about who, what or where they were. One God, however, [[Smoladh]] used this opportunity to seize power over the underworld and asserted dominance over the material plane.

As [[Xadul]], the embodiment of Chaos, moved further and further from the realm, the Gods attained lucidity and found themselves suppressed by the Lord of Darkness who had already established his kingdom. In this state, all of existence was blanketed by the black void.

This tyrannical rule came with a prophecy, delivered by [[Fedelm]], the Goddess of Prophecy, who, even before Smoladh took his throne, had foreseen his rise and fall. She told of the children of light vanquishing the lord of darkness, and, in an attempt to prevent this from coming to fruition, Smoladh snuck into the realm of the sky and slew [[Gr√©ine]], the God of the Sun.

To ensure that his rule was absolute, he kidnapped his rival's consort, [[Sadhbh]], the Goddess of the Sky, and imprisoned her in the [[Cthonic Remains]]. She, too, knew of the prophecy, and so, she snuck from the torturous realm below the surface and laid with the corpse of her lover. She returned to the Cthonic as to not raise suspicion, but again ascended to give birth in the celestial realm. Using the lighless corpse of their father to obscure their growing light, the twin children grew powerful and, when they were mature, lead the [[Luxomachy]] against the armies of Smoladh. 

With Smoladh defeated and banished to the realm beyond the stars, light again returned to the lands and thus drew the Time of Chaos to an end and beginning [[The Common Light]].
