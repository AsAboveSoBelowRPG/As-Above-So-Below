Phaunus is a holiday dedicated to [[Slint]], the God of Indulgence. Typically celebrated by abandoning inhibitions, indulging in dancing, feasting, drinking and group sex. While Phaunus is a celebration of unfettered joy and indulgence, it is also a time of fear, as many embrace their darker aspects. It is not uncommon for fights to break out, and deaths are frequent from overindulging in food and alcohol or from the pure exhaustion.

Phaunus takes place over the course of three days and begins, annually, on the first day of [[Athair]]. While this holiday is celebrated anywhere that this [[Rustic God]] has a center of worship, the primary location where the [[Gods|God]] himself presides happens in the [[Cromlech do Deus Quebrado]] outside the city of [[Porto Coelbren]]. Though this is the heart of the God's territory, the people here dread the coming of the festival each year, as it always leads to a number of tragic deaths.
