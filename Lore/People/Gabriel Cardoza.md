Sr. Cardoza is a respected businessman in the [[Aldeia de Raiz]] where he runs '**Tabacaria Cabina**', a small tobacco shop. Over the many years he has been in business, the Tabacaria has grown, first into more of a general provisioner and then into a store dealing in expensive antiques and artifacts that seem far too precious to occupy a shelf in the small village. Despite being outside the budget for the local population, he is constantly making deals and exchanges with merchants in other villages.

As such, Sr. Cardoza has employed two wagon guards to escort his shipments as they come and go. [[Lena Alvarado|Lena]] and [[Manuel Alvarado]] have served Cardoza in this position for many years. They occupy the apartment above the shop.

Sr. Cardoza has a reputation as a man who can procure just about anything, if the price is right. How he developed this network of suppliers is uncertain, as he has spent his entire life in the village, and has never left.  Regardless, he is a kind man and provides for his community, never letting anyone go without. As such, he is a beloved and pivotal member of the village - his opinion and word carries great weight.
