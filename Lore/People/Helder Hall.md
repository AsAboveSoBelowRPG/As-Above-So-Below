Helder Hall is a blacksmith serving the settlement of [[Moradu]]. Longing for a life of excitement and prestige, Helder made a deal with the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic]] [[Dagdromen]] for three enchanted items: bellows that blow with the power of the southern gale, coals that are eternally burning and a hammer that always crafts a masterpiece. In return for these gifts, he was tasked with equipping an unseen army with weapons and armor. As soon as this task finished, the trickster god destroyed the forge and took back his enchanted hammer

Helder posted a listing on the new [[Job Board]], enlisting the [[AAA Fixers For You]] to track down the archdemon and retrieve his enchanted hammer. After the group completed the task for which they were hired, it was revealed that Helder's wife died in the destruction of his forge, something he completely neglected to mention as one of his precious things lost to the fire.

Doing his best to hide the shame of his bargain from the citizens of Moradu, Helder quietly set about rebuilding his business in a small shed on the Quinta do Flor de Mel.
