Theda is a mysterious woman who claims to be the rightful occupant of the [[The De Cabra Murders|D'Albergaria Estate]]. Town ledgers have no record of a woman by the name of **Theda Vidigueira**, though, if her claims are to be believed, she would have been born before the settlement of the valley. By her own words, Theda inhabited the property on which the estate was built long before  **Francisco D'Albergaria** commissioned the construction of the Solar on the property overlooking the village of Aldeia de Raiz.

Though she has proven to be a hospitable host for those whom she has invited into her home, she has made a number of threatening comments about inhabitants of the past, and about [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo]] and [[Magdalena Isabel A'Dora Glumbo]]; the current owners of the estate. She claims they are in the house, but it is mildly upsetting that she is the one to welcome the group inside, rather than their known acquaintances. 

# The Offer

Upon inviting the group into the manor, she extends an offer to them - become 'actors' in a 'play'. She says this same production is performed one night only every eighty years, and that their arrival seems too auspicious for them not to take staring roles in the play. Concerningly, she mentions that she thought she might have to ask "Mithá or Loro" for a repeat performance, informing the group that the two are awake and in the house somewhere.

She gave the group an axe and invited them to explore the manor if it would aid in their 'investigation', and she assured them that they'd eventually come around to helping her. She retreated to the second floor while the others explored the rooms of the first floor.

When the group rejoined her in the upstairs sitting room, she offered them fine wine and good company, again, doubling down on trying to convince the party that they ought to take part in her grim pageant. Still uncertain as to whether she could be trusted, no one committed to her scheme, nor did they initially accept her gruesome weapon - an executioner's axe. They would again encounter Theda while exploring the third floor trophy room; again imploring the group to join her cause. This time she was less patient, but still left the group to explore at their own pace.
