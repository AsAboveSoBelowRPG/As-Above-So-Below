Theda is a mysterious woman who claims to be the rightful occupant of the [[The De Cabra Murders|D'Albergaria Estate]]. Town ledgers have no record of a woman by the name of **Theda Vidigueira**, though, if her claims are to be believed, she would have been born before the settlement of the valley. By her own words, Theda inhabited the property on which the estate was built long before  **Francisco D'Albergaria** commissioned the construction of the Solar on the property overlooking the village of Aldeia de Raiz.

Though she has proven to be a hospitable host for those whom she has invited into her home, she has made a number of threatening comments about inhabitants of the past, and about [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo]] and [[Magdalena Isabel A'Dora Glumbo]]; the current owners of the estate. She claims they are in the house, but it is mildly upsetting that she is the one to welcome the group inside, rather than their known acquaintances. 

Theda is one of three sisters who previously vied for control of Mag Duinn, despite their binding as both family and members of a hag's coven. Around the time of her death, the three ceased warring and appeared to be working towards a common goal. The identities and locations of these sisters is a guarded secret and, as of yet, unknown.

# The Offer

Upon inviting the group into the manor, she extends an offer to them - become 'actors' in a 'play'. She says this same production is performed one night only every eighty years, and that their arrival seems too auspicious for them not to take staring roles in the play. Concerningly, she mentions that she thought she might have to ask "Mithá or Loro" for a repeat performance, informing the group that the two are awake and in the house somewhere.

She gave the group an axe and invited them to explore the manor if it would aid in their 'investigation', and she assured them that they'd eventually come around to helping her. She retreated to the second floor while the others explored the rooms of the first floor.

When the group rejoined her in the upstairs sitting room, she offered them fine wine and good company, again, doubling down on trying to convince the party that they ought to take part in her grim pageant. Still uncertain as to whether she could be trusted, no one committed to her scheme, nor did they initially accept her gruesome weapon - an executioner's axe. They would again encounter Theda while exploring the third floor trophy room; again imploring the group to join her cause. This time she was less patient, but still left the group to explore at their own pace.

# Final Confrontation

When confronted by [[AAA Fixers For You|the group of investigators]] in her attic lair, they were given one last chance to side with Theda and take the lives of the Lord and Lady. Here, the offer was finally refused, which lead to a great slaughter. It seemed that the hag and her minions had easily overpowered the group, but Lord Elgor was able to distract Theda by accepting her mark and agreeing to slay the couple as her thrall.

During this distraction, the group was able to tend to their wounds and gain the upper hand. One by one her servants were slain - first [[The De Cabra Murders|Loro D'Albergaria]] and then her familiar Filthy Jasper. Theda was inevitably killed when Ernie transformed into a raging boar and impaled her on his mighty tusks. Her body was pulled into Kadav's bag for some grim purpose.

Having thus been dispatched, the house began to crumble, leaving the group to flee the cursed home before they became trapped in the debris.
