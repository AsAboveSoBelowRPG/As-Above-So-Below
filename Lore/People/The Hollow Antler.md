The Hollow Antler is an Inn and Tavern located in the village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]], and is operated by [[Anna Leandro]]. While it typically sees more business as a tavern, the building does host two communal rooms, each with two beds. These beds can be rented for either two or five gold per night, depending on which room.

The crowned jewel of the space is the stage that sits in the middle of the dining room - every night there is live music, typically Fado singing by the talented young [[Branca Alvarado]]. Mayor [[Rodrigo De Maya]]'s daughter [[Julia De Maya|Julia]] tends the bar. Both draw large crowds of people who desire to be in the presence of these beautiful young women.

The inn was tangentially involved in a small scandal when the janitor [[Jose Sujeira]] was [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira|found dead]] in the village square outside the business. A [[AAA Fixers For You|group of investigators]] rented the rooms while they investigated the crime. Neither the Hollow Antler or Anna were implicated in the murder.
