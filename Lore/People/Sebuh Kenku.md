Born into a rookery of [[Kenku]] bandits in the woodlands of central [[Gallacão]], Sebuh spent most of his life with his flock, performing mild acts of burglary on those who would pass through his native territory. Though he spent much of his life in this carefree way, a conflict with his partner and flock-kin, [[Rio Brando]], left him isolated from his family and home. Following the advice of an entity known as [[Kadav]], Sebuh made a pilgrimage north where he came upon [[Moradu]] and a band of fledgling [[Fixer|Fixers]]. Together they would found the [[AAA Fixers For You]], a prominent band that has involved themselves in many historic events.

# Early Life

Like many Kenu born in and around [[Novelo]], Sebuh is the offspring of the Flocksire [[Corvo Rosso]]. Though his father was not directly involved in Sebuh's life, he was a figure of notoriety in the area, and considered to be something of a legend - not just to the Kenku society - but to the people of Western Gallacão who saw him as something of a mascot.

Rather than growing up with a strong central influence in his life, Sebuh instead leaned heavily on the others of [[The Rookery]], eventually coalescing into a flock that carried out minor feats of robbery and banditry. Though the group was known in the area, they were tolerated because they also worked to keep the wildlands safe along the road - the lost wealth was considered an appropriate payment for this service.

Among those in Sebuh's flock, his closest companion was Rio Brando. The two of them developed a technique involving Sebuh's gift for mimicry and Rio's guile and nimble claws. The two performed countless heists and became minor celebrities among the Kenku of the rookery.

# The Botched Job

Sebuh's relationship with Rio came to a dramatic end during a botched burglary of a wagon train. As per usual, Sebuh employed his gift of mimicry to split the party, luring many of them deep into the woods; meanwhile Rio was meant to sneak through the camp and steal what he could get his hands on. However, when Sebuh doubled back he was horrified to find that Rio had slaughtered a number of innocent unarmed people, all for little more than a few rations and a pittance in coins.

The Kenku was so shocked by this senseless bloodshed that he didn't notice the wagonguard, a stout halfling known as [[Hogg Tanaka]], had crept up behind him and captured him. Having lost his commission for safe passage as the wagonguard, Hogg sought to at least collect a bounty for the murderous thief, and so embarked with his prisoner towards [[Salasandra]].

Without a means of transportation, this journey was long and arduous. During this time, the two bonded - with the Halfling cursing and shouting at the bird and Sebuh parroting the words back to the gruff bruiser in his own voice. Over the course of the long days traversing the woodlands, the two grew close and bonded; both being loners without a purpose, they found solace in the company.

While traveling through the wetlands of the [[Rio Zêzere]] delta, the pair came upon a shuttered lodge called [[Taberna Burguer Duende]]. Having trekked all day through damp and unforgiving wetlands, Hogg was looking forward to a warm bed and a hot meal - looking to earn favor with his new friend, Sebuh used his technical skills to pick the lock. Surprisingly, when the door was open, the tavern was revealed to be occupied by a number of gnolls who were terrorizing the captive innkeeper, [[Boca DeCarne]].  Between the two of them, the duo was able to defeat the vicious gang and free the innocent man, who thus rewarded them with the food and lodging Hogg so desired.

That night, Hogg saw the good in Sebuh's heart and, since the two had grown close through their adventure, granted him his freedom. The next morning the two parted as friends, as Hogg left to seek his next adventure.

# Travels North

Knowing he was unable to return to the Rookery, Sebuh was left with little in terms of direction. The Royal City of Salasandra was not far from the Tavern, but life for a solo Kenku in the city was rough and often led to the life of crime he was so appalled to see his dear friend engage in. So it was that he posted up in the trees near the inn for some time, watching people pass through. Using his adept skill of tinkering, he started to construct amusing trinkets, toys and automatons which he sold or traded to the people who came by the inn.

One such traveler was an avian inventor [[Dr. Horatio Flappe]]. Passing en route to the port in [[Santa Iria]], Dr. Flappe was quite impressed with the handiwork displayed by the young Kenku. As an inventor, the doctor helped Sebuh improve his designs and inspired him to construct more advanced equipment. Sebuh and Flappe travelled together to the Port, where the two engaged in a short mentorship while the doctor awaited his departure. As a flightless avian, the Kenku always dream of taking to the sky, and Flappe encouraged Sebuh to pursue his dream.

When Flappe embarked on his journey, Sebuh was again left without companions or direction, and so began to traverse the wilderness, scavenging monster dens, ruins and abandoned carts, occasionally resorting to petty theft if the opportunity presented itself. In a cave at the foot of the [[Serra Várzea]], the curious bird found a dead body draped in extravagant robes that appeared to have died guarding a chest. Since the man was long since passed, Sebuh picked the lock only to find an odd horned skull. Assuming it carried some worth, since it was at least important enough to lock in a chest, Sebuh stuck it in his pack and carried forward.

It wasn't until some time later that he began hearing a voice; sinister whispers beckoning him to head north. So persistent was the call, which appeared to be associated with the demonic skull, that to silence the plea, Sebuh formed a homonculous around it, which he dubbed [[Kadav]]. Despite the minor annoyance, and ignoring the malevolence of the source, Sebuh was given direction for the first time since leaving his Flock and headed North as the voice begged.

# AAA Fixers For You

After weeks of travelling around the [[Lordless Lands]], Sebuh came upon the settlement of [[Moradu]] where he met a group of strangers gathering on the outskirts. Rather than being chased off in fear or discrimination, Sebuh was welcome around their fire and, the following day, invited to join them on their exploits. Due to this partnership and acceptance, he assumed this was the 'destination north' he was meant to seek, and settled into his life with the Fixers.

It was with these strangers that Sebuh finally found a sense of community and belonging again; eventually considering them his new flock. Under the guidance of [[Bo Skaal]], the group formed a Fixer band dubbed the [[AAA Fixers For You]], and Sebuh was given a guild license for the [[Ordem de Reparação]] by the Secretary of State, [[Eurynomea Xanthippe]].

Within the group, Sebuh is highly regarded as a resourceful and efficient artificer. His mechanical defenders have been crucial in the group's ability to take on highly dangerous listings, as well as providing defense at their headquarters.

# Chorando Maldição

During their tenure in Moradu, the group became aware of a curse that seemed to be afflicting the residents of the settlement. It seemed that anyone who shed tears in the village would be found dead the next day. While the group was vigilant about this curse - whether it was circumstance or superstition - nothing was posted on the [[Job Board]] to investigate the suspicious deaths.

Unfortunately, this curse took hold of Sebuh when he was brought to tears, seeing one of the sacred trees in the Dryad's Grove senselessly cut down. Though his vulnerability was enough to earn the trust of the surly [[Osna Chléibh]], it also put him under the influence of the [[Chorando Maldição]]. All the members of the band slept uneasily that night, fearing what they may find come morning.

This fear was alleviated slightly when they woke to find, not just Sebuh, Bo Skaal both locked in a fitful sleep. Luckily, the two pulled through and Bo was able to recount that the two of them were locked in the Kenku's memories, stalked relentlessly be a being of pure darkness. Working together, the two were able to defeat this shadow and free Moradu from its influence.

Since then, Bo and Sebuh have had a near telepathic bond, allowing the Kenku to communicate on a deeper level with the leader of the band, rather than piecing together phrases through simple mimicry.
