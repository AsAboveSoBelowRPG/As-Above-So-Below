Gaspar Glumbo is one of the few surviving members of [[Clan Glumbo]], a proud and historic family that have ruled as the elected officials of the northern settlement of [[Moradu]] since its foundation. As such, Gaspar, or simply 'Glumbo' as he is affectionately referred to, serves as the village alderman since the death of his younger brother [[Donilo Glumbo]].

Never particularly suited for a life of leadership, Glumbo is often seen as aloof and sometimes even as inept. His role as the leader of the settlement has recently gained favorable approval after his insistence on installing a [[Job Board]] in the city. Though banned for centuries, this measure seems to have had a positive impact on revitalizing the city and drawing attention from as far south as [[Salasandra]]. 

Perhaps the greatest asset Gaspar has brought to life in Moradu is the [[Fixer]] band [[AAA Fixers For You]], which worked tirelessly to improve life in the settlement by accepting a wide variety of tasks from the citizens of the village. With the Fixers as his agents of change, Moradu is on the cusp of a new golden age.
