Esparatz is a 5th generation daughter of the sea, having been born into a family of poor fishermen. When her father died and she inherited his ship, she instead turned to a life of maritime trading, finding a great success in her endeavors. In less than a decade she has expanded her operation from a single fishing vessel to a fleet of trade ships serving over a dozen ports along the southern [[Amalthea]] coastline.

Never forgetting her roots, Esparatz still lives in the same shack she was raised in and maintains her connection with those that live in abject poverty in Coelbren. Whereas her friend and mentor [[Eirenē Ávila]] opts to live among the poor, Esparatz uses her wealth and her position on [[The Council of Six]] to lift her companions out of poverty - giving them simple opportunities to elevate themselves, just as she was given by her father.

Second only to Eirene in popularity, Esparatz serves on the Council and uses it as a platform to equalize the imbalance of wealth in a city that saw rapid economic growth. Her endeavors have seen an increase on import tariffs that contribute to a fund used to provide low-interest loans to aspiring local businesses. The first fruit of this initiative was a loan given to a young fisherman, [[Odilon Cruz]], to purchase an old smuggling ship in order to set up his own trade route between [[Faraon]] and Coelbren.
