Joao moved to [[Aldeia de Raiz]] in 3'2066, making him a relatively fresh outsider. He claims to be from a small village called Aldeia de Fogo, and that it was razed by a violent population of swamp-dwellers, though no one has ever heard of the village before - not even [[Gabriel Cardoza]] who seems to have business contacts in every corner of the realm.

Regardless, Joao settled and quickly set up a forge - and it is perhaps only by virtue of his impressive craftsmanship that he was able to integrate into the society at all. His metalworking is always slightly more decorative and ornate than asked for, and always of a high quality. His customers never complain when they receive goods of a greater quality than they paid for.

Attached to his property, Joao had a small shack that he rented out to [[Jose Sujeira]], a problematic man from the village. The two quarreled constantly - either about the condition of the rented property or about his back-due rent. Their relationship came to a fever pitch when the smith found out Jose had attempted to pawn a number of his tools to Sr. Cardoza. Unfortunately this antagonistic relationship made Joao a prime suspect when Jose was [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira|found dead]].

Throwing additional fuel on the fires of suspicion, it was uncovered that Joao and [[Julia De Maya]] were having a secret relationship - something that Jose discovered and threatened to expose. Though Julia claims Joao didn't know she was being blackmailed by Jose, it can't be said for certain. The investigation is still open and ongoing.
