Marcelino Barbosa is a Holy Knight in the army of [[Gharve]] that was awarded the rule over the [[Coelbren (Region)|District of Coelbren]] during the war with the neighboring [[Umayyad]] empire. For over twenty years Barbosa served as the warden of Coelbren, using it as a tactical stage for the defense of Gharve and the conquest of their rival. His role as the governor of the region was eliminated after the armistice and ensuing peace with Umayyad. Furious about the public shame of being stripped of his position, the knight retreated to his estate, [[Quinta Do Vento]] and cut himself off from society.
