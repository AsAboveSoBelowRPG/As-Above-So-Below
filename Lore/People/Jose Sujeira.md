Jose Sujeira became a character of intrigue when he was discovered dead in the Aldeia de Raiz town square. His throat was cut from ear to ear in a single clean line and his head was adorned with the funerary crown, traditional to the followers of [[The Ashen Bough]]. His death instigated an investigation to identify his killer - in order to maintain peaceful and unbiased justice, the mayor [[Rodrigo De Maya]] enlisted the help of [[AAA Fixers For You|a group of outsiders]] to conduct the investigation.

While he failed to accomplish much in life, [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira]] served to impact the entire village.
