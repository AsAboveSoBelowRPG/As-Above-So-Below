Eurynomea Xanthippe is the acting secretary of state for the [[Order of Nobility]] in the city of Salasandra. Her primary job is to act as a liaison between the wants and desires of the royal court and the needs of the common people of [[Gallacão]]. 

Though she has a stern appearance and a cold mannerism, Eurynomea cares deeply about the people she serves and fights tirelessly to provide for them through her position.
