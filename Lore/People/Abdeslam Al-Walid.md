Abdeslam is effusive and friendly, even in face of his general unfavorable reputation. Abdeslam owns a fleet of cargo ships that connect a number of important ports along the southern coast of [[Amalthea]]. His business savvy made him an excellent candidate to sit on [[The Council of Six]], despite his unpopularity.

Though a native of Coelbren, Abdeslam spent most of his life in the warring nation of [[Umayyad]] where he established a massive shipping network and amassed great wealth. Once the war was over, Abdeslam returned home to expand his interest into Gharve. This was met with eager approval of the Merchant's Guild, who see the man as an asset for their plans.

In spite of it all, he invests great sums to improve his home city and takes his appointment to the council very seriously. He hopes that, in time, he will be seen as more than a war profiteer and be accepted as a true son of Coelbren.
