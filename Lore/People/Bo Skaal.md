Known both for his role as the trumpet player in the travelling band [[The Flame Stompers]] and as the leader of the [[Fixer]] group [[AAA Fixers For You]]. Though he is best known for his enduring positivity and musical expertise, it is his unwavering moral compass that made him a natural leader. Despite his work as a Fixer, Bo strives to share his unconventional genre of music with the world.

# Early Life

Bo was born to a human mother and an Elven father in [[Sagacidade]]; the city of sages. His father, a renowned teacher at the [[Quatrograde]] University - though a powerful and competent warlock - was well-known among the faculty for his proclivities towards his younger students. After seducing the young [[Lea Jangles]], [[Lars Skaal]] convinced the student to pause her studies to care for the child, though it was no surprise when he quickly lost interest and instead sought affection from other young students.

Lea raised Bo without any contribution from his father, and despite their many struggles, she never disparaged Lars. Because she had to abandon her higher education, Lea took a number of jobs as a barmaid before landing a job managing a lively tavern in Sagacidade. It was in this tavern, [[The Pitch Pipe]], that Bo was first exposed to live music; a form of art that kindled a lifelong passion in his heart.

When he was a child, a fledgling band played at the tavern, using unconventional instrumentation and dance in their performance. Though they had just started their career, The Flame Stompers left an incredible impact on his life, and Bo spent years practicing with a trumpet to recreate the sounds he experienced during that performance.

# Scholarly Pursuits

When Bo came of age, he was invited to apply to the [[Quatrograde]] University where his father Lars was a director. Wishing to prove his worth to his absentee father, Bo eagerly accepted the invitation.

During his time at Quatrograde, Bo had the misfortune to spend more time with his half-brother [[Leif Skaal]], who was also a student of the school. Despite being another of Lars' illicit offspring, Leif managed to inherit all the worst traits without any of the wit or talent. To make up for his shortcomings, Leif became a pompous lackey to his father, engaging in the dirty deeds Lars needed tending to, but was unwilling to sully with his own hands. Even though there was a clear disdain between Lars and Leif, the child still thought himself to be better than Bo and treated him accordingly.

Though Bo made his best effort to please his father and meet his lofty expectations, it was clear that he would never live up Lars impossible standards. While Bo was a bright student, his heart was never aligned with the life of a scholar and quickly resentment took the place of his desire to please his father.

# The Flame Stompers

During a break between semesters, Bo returned home to spend time with his mother at The Pitch Pipe. It just so happened that during this break, the traveling musical troupe The Flame Stompers, which Bo had seen when he was just a boy, came back through on their tour. By this point the band, under the leadership of The Dragon Heir, [[Byron Lee]], the band had become wildly popular in [[Luavila]], and was looking to take their act on the road through the villages of [[Iberys]]. 

As Bo watched the band that night, he was reminded of the passion for music he carried. The pomp and pageantry of school suddenly felt so trivial and petty, and he wanted nothing more than to live the way the people on stage were living. That night, long after the crowd had filtered out of the tavern, Bo expressed this desire to Byron, and gave him a little recital on his trumpet. The band leader was so impressed; not just with the musical proficiency, but with Bo's spirit and determination. Byron said that school sounded like a drag, and that he should drop out and join the band. So that's what Bo did.

For years the band toured Northern [[Amalthea]], building a reputation in the major population centers, as well as smaller villages like [[Sertã]], which are famous for their live performances. During this time Bo was also introduced to life as a [[Fixer]], as most of the band were registered members of the [[Ordem de Reparação]]. To supplement their income, Bo also became a Fixer and they group would take jobs occasionally when they didn't have enough gold to get from one city to the next.

This was the happiest Bo had ever been, and enjoyed the freedom and positivity that came with sharing his music with the world. The band operated like a surrogate family, always supporting each other in their pursuits. Unfortunately, age took its toll on many of the members who were much older than Bo when he joined the band, and in 3'2068 Byron retired from the band. Though they played a few more shows without their frontman, everyone agreed that it wasn't really The Flame Stompers without him and the band dissolved.

# AAA Fixers for You

For a few years Bo continued to travel as a solo act, and a lone Fixer. Still carrying some notoriety from his time with The Flame Stompers opened a lot of doors for him, but a solo trumpet player was a hard act to sell. As such, the gigs became more and more scarce. Life as a solo Fixer wasn't much easier, either, as most of the high-paying jobs were often taken by the large bands that controlled the flow of work.

Word came around that there was going to be a new [[Job Board]] opening in a distant northern settlement called [[Moradu]], and with no other prospects to follow, Bo decided to make the trek and see if he could scrounge up some work. As he camped outside the city waiting for the day the board would be revealed, a number of other loners began to join him at his fire. These strange companions would eventually form their own band of fixers, which they named [[AAA Fixers For You]], appointing Bo as their leader.

Though the group isn't focused on music, Bo feels a sense of belonging with the band that he had previously only felt with The Flame Stompers.
