Aldo Silvas has a great aptitude for business and loves a thrilling adventure; a combination that made him an incredible smuggler during the war between [[Gharve]] and [[Umayyad]]. His ship, A Bela Dama, was specifically built for speed and discretion, and under his leadership he was able to make a small fortune sneaking rarities over the contested waters.

When the war ended and the borders opened, there was less money to be made in smuggling than in fair trade, so Aldo transitioned his endeavors into legitimate business. Due to his aid during the war times and his aptitude with trade, the Merchant's Guild offered him a seat on [[The Council of Six]], which he eagerly accepted. Unlike many of his counterparts, he does not know modesty, and is not seen favorably by the locals of Coelbren. Among the new wave of wealthy merchants, though, he is quite popular.
