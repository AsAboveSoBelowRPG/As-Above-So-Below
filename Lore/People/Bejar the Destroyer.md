Demétrio Tomás Pereira Bejar is a famous buccaneer who was born in the coastal city of Porto Cyii in northern [[Gallacão]]. Having been born into a family of seafaring merchants, Bejar was taught the art of sailing at a young age, and spent more of his life on the sea than on solid ground. Eschewing honest work, Bejar established a humble smuggling operation in his adolescence - an endeavor that earned him modest fame and fortune. This operation came to a close when he was apprehended and jailed. He turned to open piracy after his release.

Bejar quickly earned a reputation as a fearsome and adept Buccaneer, and his ship [[The Black Arrow]] is considered one of the most imposing vessels ever built. His adventures are legendary, and it is not uncommon to hear his name and exploits being sung in dockside taverns.

Little is known about his personal life, as he tends not to leave survivors in his encounters at sea. Those who claim to have met the man give peculiar accounts of him speaking in cryptic verse. Regardless, he is known to be charming and charismatic in spite of his eccentricities.

# Blockade of Coelbren

One of Bejar's most audacious stunts was in the blockade of [[Porto Coelbren]], a affluent port city on the [[Gharve]] coastline. In the year 3'1045 Bejar sailed his ship The Black Arrow into the [[Abismo de Março]] along with a fleet of 3 ships and demanded a ransom from the city council. As this was a period of economic growth for the city due to trade routes established at sea, this was a particularly aggressive move by the buccaneer. All ships that attempted to enter the port were raided by the fleet, which increased the wealth and power of the daring rogue.
