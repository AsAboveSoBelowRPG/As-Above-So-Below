Matrim Elfonce was a member of the Nobility of the Royal City of Salasandra. As a descendent that traces a direct lineage to the old royal family, Matrim held great sway in the court and lived lavishly.

Around the time of 3'2060, Matrim began to make routine journeys into the [[Lordless Lands]], despite the inherent danger of a wealthy noble travelling through a rugged and unknown wild. Despite this, he assembled a garish convoy with a luxurious caravan and would make four trips a year, around the time of the solstices and equinoxes.

This peculiar lifestyle came to a head when his convoy was disrupted and his caravan was hijacked by a group of brigands known as the [[Trapaceiros]] in [[The Loathewood]] outside the village of [[Moradu]]. When one of his riders reported what happened to the capital, Secretary of State [[Eurynomea Xanthippe]] immediately [[The Merry Trapaceiros|posted a bounty]] for the thugs in hopes of a safe return of the baron.

Despite the job being accepted by a fledgling group of [[Fixer|Fixers]] known as the [[AAA Fixers For You]], the brigands apparently executed Baron Matrim out of desperation. The Trapaceiros turned themselves in at the Royal Court in [[Salasandra]] and are awaiting execution in the royal dungeons.

# Controversy

When the Trapaceiros turned themselves in to the court in Salasandra, they brought with them the grotesque corpse of a monster, which they claimed was the true form of the Baron Matrim.

According to the narrative given by [[Farooq Masquat]], the leader of the brigands, they never intended to abduct the Baron, simply to relieve his convoy of its treasure. However, as they were investigating the trunks and chests, they were horrified to find a young boy trapped inside one of the pieces of luggage. 

The boy, [[Quim Iarr]], told the group that once a season the Baron's convoy would come through the northern realm and pick children from each village. These boys were 'recruited' to serve in the Baron's household, though their whereabouts after leaving with the noble were never again accounted for. Quim, who was chosen with his older brother [[Argus Iarr]] - who successfully escaped captivity - was then locked in a chest and transported south along the [[Kasman Road]]. 

In a panic, the Trapaceiros kidnapped the Baron, fearing if he was let free, he would victimize more children in the rural northern settlements. Half of the group was in favor of executing the wicked noble while the other half feared the repercussions of such an action. The group debated the proper course of action for several nights.

Unfortunately, by this point a bounty had been posted in Moradu and a local band of Fixers tracked the group to their woodland camp. Not knowing what else to do, the Trapaceiros explained themselves to the Fixers, who were also equally stumped as to the proper course of action. According to Farooq, this is when the Baron revealed his true form and was slain by the able-bodied Fixers.

With no alternative available to them, the brigands agreed to turn themselves in, presenting the corpse of a hideous monster as 'proof' of their story.
