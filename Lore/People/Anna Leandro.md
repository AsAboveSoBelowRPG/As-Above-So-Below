Anna was born in the village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]], the daughter of Marcos Leandro, the innkeeper. She was raised in the inn and learned, from a very young age, how to properly run every aspect of the business. By the time she was 20 years old, she had worked every position in the business. When her father passed away and she inherited the business, she didn't have a moment of discomfort taking over. She had prepared her whole life to run the business, which is much like a community hub.

Because she was trusted with deep responsibility during her upbringing, and because she believes that busy children make less mischief, she primarily employs the children of the village to work in [[The Hollow Antler]].  She is a stern boss, but beloved by the families who rely on the extra income from their work at the tavern.

She had previously employed a grown man by the name of [[Jose Sujeira]], who was unqualified for any other job in the village. Against her better judgement, she gave him a job as the janitor, but he continually caused problems with customers and spent a lot of his time making inappropriate advances at some of the other employees - especially [[Julia De Maya]]. This continued until [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira|he was found dead]] in the village square.
