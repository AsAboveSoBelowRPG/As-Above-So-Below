Eirenē is the oldest and most esteemed member of [[The Council of Six]], the committee that rules the [[Coelbren (Region)|District of Coelbren]]. She has spent her entire life in Porto Coelbren, and, despite her many hardships, she has served as a pillar of strength and integrity for the people of the city. Even during the rule of [[Marcelino Barbosa|Warden Barbosa]], the population of the city always looked to Eirenē first for leadership.

Though she could have, at any point, leveraged her position for financial gain, she has opted instead to live humbly, never rising above those that she serves. As such, she has maintained a grounded perspective of what her most unfortunate constituents are experiencing. This greatly contributes to her popularity among both the poor and the wealthy.

Despite her great compassion, Eirenē is often harsh with her words and can seem unapproachable. Those who know her well are able to read the subtlety of her moods, but outsiders are often off-put by the crass behavior of someone who is talked about as if she is a saint.
