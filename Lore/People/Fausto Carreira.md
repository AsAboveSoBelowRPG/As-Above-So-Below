Fausto, a former soldier on the front line of the war between [[Gharve]] and [[Umayyad]], served faithfully under the Holy Knight [[Marcelino Barbosa]]. When Barbosa was appointed as the warden of Coelbren, he brought his most faithful lieutenant with him to serve as the head of the city guard. Though Fausto hails from [[Coelbren (Region)|The District of Coelbren]], he has always been seen as an outsider by the people of Porto Coelbren.

Despite his unpopularity, Fausto sits on [[The Council of Six]], taking the seat first offered to his former commanding officer, Warden Barbosa. Though his voice is often the loudest at the table, it seems to carry the least weight - during the time of war, the militaristic presence in the city was oppressive. Now that the city has entered a period of peace, they are eager to lessen the presence of the armed guard, despite Fausto's warnings of the many dangers of the region.
