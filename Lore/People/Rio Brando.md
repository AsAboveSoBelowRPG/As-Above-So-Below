Flock-Kin to the [[Fixer]], [[Sebuh Kenku]], Rio Brando is a Kenku thug born in [[The Rookery]] to his Flocksire [[Corvo Rosso]]. Along with the others of his flock, Rio took to a life of mischief and thievery. For the most part, these were bloodless raids on wagon trains and wealthy merchants, and, despite the chaos, the Kenku presence was tolerated outside the village of [[Novelo]] because they kept more dangerous creatures in check.

Rio built a reputation as an adept thief, easily being able to sneak into camps and lift valuables without detection. Working with his friend Sebuh, who was skilled at mimicry, the duo was able to perform countless daring raids without ever engaging in combat.

This changed one day when Rio was discovered pilfering goods from a wagon of refugees, and, in a panic, he murdered them in cold blood. Hearing the screams, Sebuh arrived to witness the scene before being captured by the wagonguard [[Hogg Tanaka]].  Rio fled in terror back to the flock. His whereabouts and activities since this moment have been unknown; though it is suspected he fled to the capital [[Salasandra]] to avoid the repercussions of his actions.
