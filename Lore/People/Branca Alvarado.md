Branca is a young orphan - oldest of three that were adopted by [[Lena Alvarado|Lena]] and [[Manuel Alvarado]]. Though she doesn't recall her life before being taken in by the couple, her old life still haunts her dreams with reoccurring nightmares of vicious crows.

Having spent nearly a decade in [[Aldeia de Raiz]], she is not seen as an outsider, but as one of their own. She has an incredible talent as a vocalist and works for [[Anna Leandro]] as a Fado singer over at [[The Hollow Antler]]. She has a dedicated following, and people travel from distant villages just to hear her sing.

She has a dream of travelling [[Mag Duinn]] and performing in every village. She has discussed this with her parents, and, while they support her, they also know how dangerous the outside world is. They haven't told her no, they simply ask for her patience as they try to arrange for a capable escort for her tour.
