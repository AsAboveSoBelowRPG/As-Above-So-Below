Bixo is a wandering poet affiliated with the legendary [[Fellowship of the Seven Petals]], a group of heroes that rose to prominence in the capital region of [[Iberys]]. Though he would refuse the title, it is generally accepted that Bixo is the leader of the fellowship.

Not much is known about his early life, prior to his arrival in [[Conexão]]. He first surfaces in the small village as a fixture of the market stalls and riverside cafes in the company of various intellectuals and artists. He became quite popular and, within short time, became an eccentric fixture - wracking up sizable tabs and trading poetry for food and wine.

# Early Career

## Prophecy

In the year 3'3237, at the age of 35, Bixo had a haunting dream, it followed a sequence: footsteps in hot ash, a featureless being of shadows, a lantern that cast no light. Thinking it more of a curiosity than anything, Bixo mentioned this vision to his friend [[Marçal Passante]] - a local scholar charged with keeping the stories of the village - he was informed that three other people reported having oddly similar dreams in the preceding nights.

The two took it upon themselves to investigate further by seeking out the others; a priestess, a smith and a child. 

The first they visited was a young priestess named [[Adelina das Flores|Adelina]] who served to bless the western pools. Immediately the young poet fell in love with her, though her duty refused to allow her to accept his charms - regardless, the two of them shared a cigarette and the details of their dreams.

Next in line was the blacksmith [[Cilistro Novo]]. The humorless mountain of a man was even less welcoming once he found out that the two of them had come to talk about his dream. Cilistro tossed aside a ruined sword to sit on his anvil for a short chat, but Bixo took great interest in the scrap metal - asking the man how much such a thing would cost. He scoffed at the offer, informing him that it was a ruined project, and unfinished at that. Bixo insisted it was perfect, as he was similarly flawed and unfinished. This earned the man's respect, and he preceded to divulge the details of his dream.

Lastly was a a young orphan being raised by an old woman in the *Bairro de Tela*.
