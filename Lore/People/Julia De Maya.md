Julia is the daughter of Mayor [[Rodrigo De Maya]] and [[Monica De Maya]], and is deeply beloved by the villagers who adore her polite mannerisms, her kind spirit and her enduring beauty that stands in contrast to the dreary ambience of the valley. For two years she has worked as a bartender at [[The Hollow Antler]] - and, while [[Anna Leandro]] would never admit it, her employment has increased revenue at the tavern by great measures.

Born and raised in [[Aldeia de Raiz]], Julia wants, more than anything, to leave her hometown and explore distant places. When [[Joao De Pedra]] moved to town, she had an immediate fascination with the man. She saw him as someone exotic and exciting, and dreamed that maybe he would fall in love with her and take her out of this grim village.

This romance would only serve to cause her utter dismay - when their secret dalliance was discovered by the scheming [[Jose Sujeira]], he used it as blackmail to secure a small fortune from the naive young girl. When Jose later [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira|turned up dead]], Julia became a prime suspect in his slaying.
