Rodrigo De Maya is an esteemed member of the community of Aldeia de Raiz and a devout follower of [[The Ashen Bough]]. For over a decade Rodrigo has served as the mayor of the village - a position he takes great pride in.

In his professional life, de Maya is a strict record keeper and believes it is his duty to future generations to make sure life in the valley is meticulously documented; it is on the strength of this conviction that he was elected to the position. He promises that future generations will remember every citizen and their contribution to the community.

In his personal life, Rodrigo married his childhood sweetheart [[Monica De Maya]]. Together, the couple gave birth to their only child - a daughter they named [[Julia De Maya]]. Rodrigo is a loving father and husband, he considers these roles to carry the same importance as his political career.

# Political Initiatives

In addition to keeping meticulous records of daily life in the village, Rodrigo also wishes to uncover as much about the past as he can. In this endeavor he has enlisted the aid of the village antiquarian [[Inez Celezia]]. There was some conflict when Inez uncovered a history of brutal murders that took place in the old [[The De Cabra Murders|D'Albergaria Estate]] - something she believed should be made public, but Rodrigo felt cast life in the valley into an unfavorable light. Ultimately they agreed to include the information in the village archive, but not to disclose the discovery.

This information complicated a different initiative that Rodrigo had put into place - gifting the abandoned estate to [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo]], the Lord of [[Mag Duinn]]. This was proposed during a town hall meeting as a way to curry favor with the Lord, hoping it might ultimately inspire him to visit their struggling village.

As the estate had already been given to the Glumbos, and years had passed without so much as an acknowledgement, Rodrigo decided the gesture was symbolic and they shouldn't worry too much about the supposed curse. This decision would come to haunt the mayor when the Lord and Lady arrived only a few nights before the cycle would continue.
