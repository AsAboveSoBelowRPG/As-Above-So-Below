Limgrave Aire is a member of the [[Anlaith]], a radical group of elves banished from [[Anduantas]] for their dangerous beliefs and violent tendencies. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Limgrave was born in [[Mór Neamhnitheach]] and only saw his ancestral home after the terrorists emerged from the [[Cthonic Remains]] to topple the [[Hall of the Oracle]].

Because he was born in the hostile darkness of the underworld, Limgrave has uncanny senses and built a reputation as a brutal and adept tracker. As such, he was chosen to lead one of the scouting parties sent to the surface to uncover the location of the hidden village. Despite years of searching to no avail, Limgrave was relentless in his patrols. His dilligence paid off when he came upon the young poet [[Niamh Chéanna]], who he abducted and tortured until she revealed the location of the hidden village.

Returning with a force of [[Bligeárd]] lead by [[Aodhán Ó Dubhartaigh]], Limgrave delighted in joining the assault of Anduantas. Because of his pivotal role in the raid, he was promoted to the lead tracker among the Anlaith, and tasked with tracking down the Oracle [[Méabh Daibhéid]] and her family, which had fled the city before the raid.

Even though he was an adept fighter, he met his end when he was sent to dispatch a group of mercenaries known as the [[AAA Fixers For You]] that had unintentionally become entangled in the conflict. The group easily overpowered him and his entourage.
