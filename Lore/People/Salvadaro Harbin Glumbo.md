Sal Glumbo is the lord of [[Mag Duinn]], a [[Cthonic Remains|Cthonic]] realm between life and death. While his past is a mystery, even to himself, he has peacefully ruled over his kingdom for as long as he or anyone else can recall.

A bon vivant by nature, Sal loves to travel his kingdom with his wife [[Magdalena Isabel A'Dora Glumbo]] to explore and sample the simple pleasures that his reign has yeilded. Typically they travel via the [[O Nazerack Expresso]], as it is the fastest way to traverse the lands.

When he is not living as a man about town, his primary duty is in giving fresh life to the disembodied spirits that arrive in his lands. The Nazerack collects the spirits of those who were sacrificed in the surface world and gives them fresh flesh so they may live again in his paradise. 

As far as Sal and Magda know, his subjects in Mag Duinn live in an unchallenged wonderland, though recent events have lead him to the understanding that his realm is much more grim than he had known. 

# The Crash of O Nazerack

While out on a casual jaunt, a corrupting presence [[All Aboard! O Nazerack Expresso|infiltrated O Nazerack Expresso]] and caused it to crash in the wilds outside of the village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]]. While he and his wife were lucky to survive the crash and the ensuing melee with the mutant heart of the living ship, he quickly discovered that he lost his godly powers, rendering him as nothing more than a man.

While Sal attempts to put on a brave face, his [[Excerpts from the Diary of Sal Glumbo|Private Journal]] reveals that he is quite distressed - both by the loss of his power and by the state of his kingdom. Seeing how the people of the Aldeia suffer while he lives a lavish life makes him double his resolve to be more attentive once he regains his powers.

# The D'Albergaria Estate

As an attempt to curry favor with the Lord of the Land, the mayor of Raiz, [[Rodrigo De Maya]], had, years ago, gifted the Glumbos the massive estate outside of town. Though they never made an attempt to visit prior to the crash, they were pleased to have a place to stay when they crashed nearby.

Unbeknownst to the couple, the estate is also the site of a cycle of [[The De Cabra Murders|gruesome murders]] that occurs every 80 years. It just so happens that they arrived just nights before the 80th anniversary of these slayings. The two were abducted by an alleged hag who calls herself [[Theda Vidigueira]]. Though the [[AAA Fixers For You|group of adventurers]] they met on the train have entered the house to mount a rescue, their fate is still unknown.
