Born to a noble family in the gilded city of Scathanna in the [[Cthonic Remains|Cthonic]] realm of Mag Duinn, Magda has always carried a strange fascination with divination and speaking with the dead. Despite her eccentricities, her effusive personality and her enduring beauty caused her to catch the eye of [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo]], the lord of the land. After a brief courtship the two eloped and have made pleasure their life's work ever since.

Magda has great skill in communicating with spirits; something she has always viewed as a gift - even when her fascination with the afterlife made her a social outcast. She believes she was born with this ability for a reason, and is always happy to share her special skills with others. This naiveté seems to define her personality and betrays her privileged, sheltered upbringing.

Regardless of all, she is a sincere and kind woman who genuinely welcomes the opportunity to meet new people and explore new places. Even in the face of great strife, she maintains her positivity.

# Aldeia de Raiz

Magda's dream life was challenged when she and her husband were involved in a terrible shipwreck about [[O Nazerack Expresso]], which left them stranded in the small village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]]. Luckily the two of them walked away unscathed, thanks in large part to a group of [[AAA Fixers For You|strange heroes]], but the nightmare had only just begun for the two of them.

They first counted themselves lucky in that the mayor [[Rodrigo De Maya]] had gifted them a glorious estate outside of town years prior, but the enormous house was host to more than just the two of them - a number of concerned spirits begged the woman to leave the house through her spirit board, and at night she was troubled by endless chattering of upset ghosts.

Above the chatter came a single voice that spoke to her with confidence and strength - the voice of the house. It sought to drown out the voices of the the spirits; to calm and reassure the woman. Despite the unsettling conflict between these voices, when her husband Sal asked her to explore an attic he discovered hidden in the study, she couldn't resist the excitement and happily accompanied him.
