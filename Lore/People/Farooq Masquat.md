Farooq is a young and charismatic leader of a small band of do-good bandits called [[Trapaceiros|The Merry Trapaceiros]]. Giving a home and a purpose to those who were unable to function within society, or were outright rejected from it, Farooq established a camp deep inside [[The Loathewood]], a dangerous wilderness in the [[Kasmanium Range]].

Following a strong moral code, Farooq routinely targets the rich, and entertains them with feasts, plays or concerts when they pass through his woods; then charging them a steep fee for the privilege. The isolation and insinuation of violence usually allows them to lift a handsome sum from these unfortunate nobles. Keeping only what they need to survive, the Trapaceiros distribute the rest of the money to those in the community who are impoverished and suffering.

Unfortunately this behavior put his people in great risk when they abducted a baron from the royal capital of [[Salasandra]], [[Matrim Elfonce]], after discovering he was transporting abducted children in his wagon. Having meddled with an important noble from the city, a bounty was then placed on his head, which a group of fledgling Fixers, [[AAA Fixers For You]] sought to collect.

Exposing the Baron as a horrific monster, the Trapaceiros sought to clear their good name by turning themselves in with the corpse of the monstrous baron  to the Royal Court. Unfortunately, the court dismissed their evidence as manufactured and imprisoned Farooq and his cohorts.
