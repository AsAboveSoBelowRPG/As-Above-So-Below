Not much is known about the life of Muhsina before she entered into her service to the [[Rustic God]] [[Slint]]. In the time since she joined the faith, though, she has been given the esteemed role of High Priestess; serving as the key religious liaison for the [[Coelbren (Region)|District of Coelbren]]. 

In addition to her holy duties, she has also been appointed to [[The Council of Six]], which rules [[Porto Coelbren]] by committee. Though she wasn't one of the initial choices for one of the coveted seats on the council, the religious devout in the region insisted that she be appointed to represent their interest.

Initially she turned the offer down, insisting that the concerns of man are not her priority, however, after communing with her Lord, she was instructed to use her position on the council to expand His influence. As of yet, she remains the quietest of the members.
