During their pursuit of [[The Salmon Slurper]], the Triple-A Fixers managed to get sidetracked by a different adventure that would change the course of their lives entirely.

## AAA Fixers: Rebirth

As political tensions in the city of [[Moradu]] came to a boil in the days leading up to the celebration of [[Festa do Anastasis]], the [[AAA Fixers For You]] busied themselves taking listings from the job board. In pursuit of a fiend known only as the Salmon Slurper, the group entered a cave that would change their fates forever.

Entering the cavern filled the adventurous band with an immediate sense of nauseating deja vu - it was as if they had been there before; done this task already. Visions of a large frog, crystaline entities and cosmic horror haunted their minds. Furthermore, their group seemed different - had it always been these four in pursuit of the Salmon Slurper? Had it always been [[Zimo the Cur]] accompanying them?

While the interior of the cave seemed familiar, it also presented uncanny new sights. Red signs detailed the events of [[Castelo Ayodar]] and the dreaded [[Primordial Gods|Primordial]] [[Nazerack]]; one such sign preceded to talk about a ethereal boat that sails between the surface world and the [[Cthonic Remains]]. The path lead them upwards, deeper into the unknown.

In a vacant ticket booth, the group found only a placard reading an enigmatic statement: *One for One*. Attached to the counter with a beaded chain, Zimo found a masterpiece **Dagger of Venom**, which he happily plucked from its tether. Less impressively, [[Sebuh Kenku]] procured a worn, stinky cushion from the unmanned stool. [[Bo Skaal]] investigated both, finding the dagger to be the better loot.

Following the sign towards "Platform A", the group discovered a haunting gathering of [[Shade|Shades]] waiting silently on benches at a paved platform by a subterranean river. Though the Fixers attempted to engage with the spirits, they found them to be unresponsive; almost statuary. While they investigated the scene, a massive form appeared down the river, making an unpleasant screech as it approached. The group hid behind the platform benches as [[O Nazerack Expresso]] pulled into the station. 

From the train, a strange gnome emerged and granted entrance to those who were listed on his clipboard. Sensing no hostility, the Fixers approached the strange boatman and asked what the purpose of the vessel was, and how one books passage. [[The Wondrous Boatman]] informed them that everyone who boards the ship must pay with a great sacrifice. Zimo, being the bravest of  the group, feeling he had little to lose, stepped forward to be the first to board, a decision he likely regretted only a moment later when a slight tap of the boatman's bone flute against Zimo's chest blew all the flesh from his bones, coating the platform in gore.

Strangely enough, though, from his bones a new entity took form - the Crimson Sorcerer [[Svorcra]] emerged from the remains, sharing hazy memories of both Zimo's past and another life lived independently. Both memories present but hazy, intermingled into something unrecognizable form either perspective. One by one, each Fixer stepped forward to be born again. [[Sebuh Kenku]] came back as the Relicborn [[Kadav Papazuzian]], the leader [[Bo Skaal]] came back at the hulking simpleton [[Errndar Bearfinder]] and last, and most trepidatiously, [[Gordo Bloodfury]] had his flesh melted only to come back as [[Elgor Silvershadow]]. Having thus made blood sacrifices, the four were permitted to enter the boat of the damned.
