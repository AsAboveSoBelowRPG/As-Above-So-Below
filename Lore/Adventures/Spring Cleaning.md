*It’s been a spell since we last had water to fill our buckets or water the fields. The last of what’s left is what you see from the spring due west of the village. You can drink from it, sure, but ain’t enough there to raise the crops or put fish on the table. Word around town is even the spring itself weeps o’er the state things when the moon shines brightest.*

*All us farmers’ve had to leave our homes cause o’ this, and ain’t it a shame? We all pooled what we had left, an’ I think it’s a fair pot for anyone who can sort out why our water went dry.*

"Spring Cleaning" was a job posted collaboratively on the [[Moradu]] [[Job Board]] by a group of local farmers who had been struggling with the sudden drying of the spring that feeds the [[Rio Silhit]].  The job was accepted by the [[AAA Fixers For You]], who agreed to investigate the sounds of sobbing heard under the light of the moon.

Much to their surprise the [[Fixer|Fixers]] found the [[Naiad]] [[Silhit]] sitting on the edge of her spring. The water spirit told the band that she feels a deep pain inside her, and that pain is suffocating her. Without aid she fears she may not have much time before she dries up and ceases to exist. Using the last of her strength, she bestowed a blessing upon the group, who traversed the narrow passages of the spring below ground.

Surprisingly, the root of Silhit's suffering wasn't the aquatic beasts that inhabited the tunnels below, rather, from a dam that was being constructed by a company of nomadic fishmen carpenters. The Fixers tussled with the workers, but called off hostilities when the foreman, a portly red fishman named [[Beck]] surrendered, claiming he wasn't being paid enough to put the lives of his people on the line.

The mastermind behind the project turned out to be a [[Kappa]] by the name of [[Woeberus]]; the self-appointed protector of the waters of [[Serra da Verra Alto]]. Claiming Silhit had a storied history of seducing the citizens of Moradu to their deaths in the cold waters of her spring, he took it upon himself to engineer a dam that would halt her waters at the source.

Unwilling to let an entire colony suffer because of a few reported deaths, the Fixers decided to put an end to the project and to destroy the dam. With the Kappa dispatched, they found evidence that it wasn't a concern for the people that drove Woeberus to confine the waters of the spring, but an unrequited love: the kappa had long lusted over the Naiad and grew more resentful watching her choose others over him.

With the villainous lovesick Kappa dispatched and the dam destroyed, the Naiad was free, once more, to flow through the mountain. According to the report filed with the [[Ordem de Reparação]], the elemental offered to reward the group with an additional gift, which was accepted by the band's treasurer, [[Milo Terd]], who was taken inside the spings water, momentarily fusing with the spirit. This moment of intimacy produced a seed, which, sealed in a jar, seems to dance and move about.

Ramifications of this job were felt by every citizen of the settlement, and by bringing the water back to the mountain they earned the respect and adoration of many who dwell there. Additionally, the carpenters were invited to set up shop in the village.

For their efforts, the Triple-A's were paid 300g.
