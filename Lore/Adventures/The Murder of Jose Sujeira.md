Having just arrived in the small village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]], the group formerly known as the [[AAA Fixers For You]] were surprised to find the residents of the town in a dark mood - shortly before they arrived a body had been discovered in the town square. The victim, an ornery janitor named [[Jose Sujeira]], was found with a clean cut across his neck, adorned with the funerary crown traditional to [[The Ashen Bough]].

The crowd of onlookers were shouting accusations against each other; each leveling a different damning theory as to why it could be anyone but themselves. With the support and sponsorship of [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo]], the group was enlisted as impartial outsiders to get to the bottom of the vicious slaying. The local constable [[Margarida Gomez]] was assigned to oversee the investigation, but was quickly dismissed when her measured approach was serving to hinder the witch hunt.

# Suspects

While it seems that nearly anyone could have found reason to want this despicable man to suffer, it seems that a few of the townsfolk had legitimate gripes with the deceased. Though the group was open to investigating anyone that came across their radar, it seemed that a number of the villagers stood out.

## Joao De Pedra

Being an outsider already sets under suspicious eyes, but it didn't help that Joao was also Jose's landlord and was known to be having a conflict with the man over back rent, and for attempting to pawn his tools to [[Gabriel Cardoza]] only a few nights prior.

## Vicente Anbrosio

Though he works as the village deputy, Vicente is known to be an abrasive drunk - and one that continually found himself at odds with Jose. It was only a couple nights before that the deputy had to be ejected from [[The Hollow Antler]] for drunkenly antagonizing Jose while he was at work; Vicente retaliated by waiting outside the tavern and arresting the janitor after his shift ended for "public intoxication". Marge released him the following morning.

While searching the deputy's apartment, they found large quantities of expensive alcohol and a suspicious locked chest. In opposition to Constable Marge's desires, the group was able to convince Mayor [[Rodrigo De Maya]] to temporarily incarcerate the deputy so he couldn't flee town or tamper with evidence.

## Julia De Maya

Though it seemed unlikely that the two would have had any cause to interact, it turns out that Julia, the mayor's daughter, had recently been seen leaving Jose's apartment at an unconscionable hour. During the course of their investigation, it came to light that Julia and [[Joao De Pedra]] were having a secret affair. 

Jose had discovered this, having seen Julia discretely coming and going from his shack behind Joao's house and used it as leverage to demand a large sum of money from the wealthy young woman. Though she paid the ransom, Jose claimed he was going to reveal the details of their illicit romance regardless. 

## Ol' Boothby

The oldest man in the village, Boothby is an eccentric mute who the village looks after. The man was found in the village square with the body, but was unable to defend his presence. Using intrusive telepathy [[Svorcra]] was able to discern that Boothby was the one who placed the wreath on the dead man's head, but was not the one who killed him.

# Other Theories

While speaking with the 'Unofficial Leader', the barber surgeon [[Gilherme Amêijoa]] presented the group with an interesting theory that may carry some weight. Apparently, the murder took place the night before an inauspicious night: a cycle of murders that occurs every 80 years.

Gil presented a theory that, perhaps the murder is associated with the grim slayings that happened nearly a century ago - [[The De Cabra Murders]]. While his proposal would require a supernatural evil to be the cause of the death, there are certainly less improbable things that the group had encountered together. The facts of this cycle of slayings was later validated by [[Inez Celezia]], the town's antiquarian and historian.

# Dinner with the Glumbos

As it so happened, the group had been invited to dinner on this grim evening, and, considering the timing, decided it might be a good time to go check on their companions. It was at this moment that the group decided to stop in for [[Dinner with the Glumbos]].
