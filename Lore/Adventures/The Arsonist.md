_By writ of Helder Hall_
_Master Blacksmith_

The Arsonist was a posting made on the [[Moradu]] [[Job Board]] in the year 3'2071 by [[Helder Hall]]. This job was accepted and completed by the [[AAA Fixers For You]], as their inaugural job as an unofficial outfit. This was also the first job accepted from the Moradu job board.

Upon meeting Master Helder, they learned that he recently made a pact with the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic]] [[Dagdromen]]. The Lord of Illusion, famous for his twisted bargains, granted the smith an enchanted bellows, ever-burning coals and a hammer that always produces masterful items. Unfortunately, once the demon was paid his due, he burned the blacksmith's forge to the ground and absconded with his magic hammer.

Tasked with the challenge of fetching the enchanted tool, the Fixers tracked the monster to the old chapel above the settlement. Here, they found Dagdromen preparing a ritual to return to his hellish domain. Amused by the ferocity with which the adventurers fought for such a mundane goal, Dagdromen agreed to return to them the smith's hammer if they made way for him to perform his ritual. With these terms established, the Fixers accomplished their goal and completed the contract.

The Triple-A's were paid 300g for the completion of this contract, though guild notes remark that the smith initially underpaid for the services of the Fixers. Luckily, they were able to secure payment in full without the need to involve the [[Recompensa]].
