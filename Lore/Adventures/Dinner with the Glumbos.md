After arriving in the small village of [[Aldeia de Raiz]], the group of [[AAA Fixers For You|adventurers]] were set to the task of uncovering the truth behind [[The Murder of Jose Sujeira]]. During the course of this investigation, the town's barber surgeon [[Gilherme Amêijoa]] informed them of a cyclical massacre that happens every 80 years in the [[The De Cabra Murders|D'Albergaria Estate]] - and that this night was the anniversary of that fateful event.

As they had been invited to join [[Salvadaro Harbin Glumbo|Sal]] and [[Magdalena Isabel A'Dora Glumbo|Magda]] Glumbo for dinner, they thought it prudent to go check in on their new acquaintances. Rather than arriving to warm greetings and a decadent feast, they found the house in a grim state of affairs.

# The 'Hag'

Greeted at the door by a woman who identified herself as the true occupant of the house, [[Theda Vidigueira]], the group was cordially invited inside. Theda, though not confrontational, was a concerning presence who explained that she had occupied this land since before the valley was settled. When the [[The De Cabra Murders|D'Alberaria Estate]] was constructed on her sacred land, she took it upon herself to inhabit the house as well.

She did not threaten the group, but rather gave them freedom to conduct their investigation in the manor. Additionally, Theda offered them a role in her 'pageant'; asking if perhaps one of them would be willing to slay the Glumbos to appease the house. When they declined, she did not become hostile; instead she left them to conduct their investigation.

# The First Floor

The walls were all adorned with haunting paintings, attributed to the late Eva De Cabra; a small gallery off the hall showcased her progression from a rustic hobbyist to a masterful artist - it also seemed to document her spiral into darkness as the subject matter became more dark and twisted as her skills improved.

The floor held a number of dangers - a haunted piano enraged the possums that inhabited the walls of the old manor and a kitchen salamander cooked a woman who was trapped in the stove alive. 

Through it all, the group was repeatedly warned to flee the house by the spirits of those that had been slain there in the past - though these warnings would be dismissed.

# The Second Floor

Theda met the group with great concern in the sitting room on the second floor - pouring them all a glass of a healing elixir and, again, asking them to partake in her ritual sacrifice. The Executioner's Axe she left for them was picked up by [[Kadav Papazuzian]].

During their conversation, a loud click was heard from deeper inside the house - they would later find that this was the sound of someone locking the bathroom door. By the time they managed to get the door open, it was too late to save the young woman who was bound in the bathtub where she was drowned in blood.

The master bedroom also held other surprises: [[Excerpts from the Diary of Sal Glumbo|Sal's Diary]] seemed to suggest that the two of them may be being held in the attic, and a disgusting old noose found in the closet appears to have recently been taken off whatever corpse it used to hold.

In a bedroom that previously belonged to some children, a haunted doll begged the group to check the room for a monster she believed to be hiding somewhere. The thing nearly took [[Elgor Silvershadow]]'s face off when he checked under the bed, but ultimately it was destroyed and the doll could finally rest peacefully. Kadav procured a creepy bag with a living nightmare contained inside.

# The Third Floor

Inside the study, a cackling fat possum was pulling stories from a nearly catatonic man. By offering his own amusing anecdote, Kadav satisfied the impish creature and it fled the room through a hole in the bookcase. The man, Glumbo's Butler, asked about the wellbeing of his family - his wife, the cook, and his daughter, the maid. Kadav gave him the rotting noose 'Just in case he needed it'.

When the group gathered in the trophy room, Theda arrived again to plead with the adventurers one more time - using the example that men are happy to sacrifice and slaughter beings they perceive as being lesser life forms simply to display their carcasses as trophies. When she left, it was unclear as to where she went.
