Amalthea is a continent sequestered from the greater masses and, as such, not much is known of Amalthea - and not much is known *IN* Amalthea of the world outside. As this land has developed in the solitude of its isolation, the understanding of the world-at-large is bound primarily to the mainland of the continent and the surrounding islands.

# History

*See main article: [[História de Amalthea]]*

Myth and legend about the origins of Amalthea and its people trace events back to a past inconceivably distant. Though there are no records dating from most of these times, modern scholars place some strong belief that a great number of these events may have happened in some fashion due to the corroborating details present across a great number of cultures that seem to trace their origins to a single common ancestor.

**The First Age**
Generally, known history is divided into three ages with the unknowable times before only hypothesized. The First Age is often referred to as the [[Time of Chaos]], was born when the unity of the divine void was shattered. Aspects of the whole formed the [[Primordial Gods]], among whom [[Smoladh]], the God of Darkness, reigned as the unsurpassed chief, taking his sister [[Sadhbh]], the Goddess of the Sky, as his consort. This age came to a close when [[The Lightbringers|The Lightbringers]], the divine twins [[Nuaré]] and [[Bánsolas]], vanquished the oppressive darkness and ushered in the dawn.

**The Second Age**
With the world brought to light, life returned and flourished. During this time Nuaré, the God of the Moon, caught sight of a beautiful nymph bathing in a spring. So captivated by her beauty, Nuaré fell in love with the [[Nymph]], [[Aislinn]], and together they gave birth to a new breed, the [[Tuatha]] - the Children of Light. With this, the second age, The Common Light, was born; a time of peace and unity. The Tuatha created many other species to join them in their paradise, including the elves, dwarves, gnomes and many other enchanted beings. The last beings created by the Tuatha were the Humans, who felt their position in the hierarchy was unjust. A violent uprising brought the first mortal death to the land and introduced war to Amalthea. The Tuatha wept over what their creation had wrought, and left for the golden city at the foot of the Goddess tree Maia in the land of Hy-Brasyl and sealed themselves away from the savagery of their once peaceful garden.

**The Third Age**
Modern recorded history begins at the dawn of the third age, in which humanity rose to prominence after the Elder Races were banished to the [[Cthonic Remains]]. During the Second Age, after the Gods abandoned the lands to their offspring, humanity was seen as an inferior being and subjugated to hard lives of servitude to the [[Tuatha]]. Along with the Dwarves, who faced similar discrimination, the humans banded together and lead a rebellion under the hero [[Oisín Desterro]], who faced off against the god [[Clábhaín]], who the oppressors had worshipped as their champion. Using the shield of the moon, *[[Gealach]]* and the chain of the sun, *[[Tintreach]]*, Oisín was able to overcome the Primordial god. As per tradition, the winner was able to draw the new boundaries, and, rather than draw a line vertically, Oisín made a horizontal sweep with his palm facing down, banishing the Tuatha to the land below. However, due to a wound sustained during the battle, his arm wavered during his gesture, leading it to rise above the horizon as he passed across the northern lands, inadvertently granting the Elder Races the lands of An-Talamh.

For Millenia, Humanity worked to establish itself in Amalthea, often working with the original custodians of the land to settle the harsh wilds. As the population grew, so did tension among the clans. Conflicts over resources, land and subjects lead humanity into a prolonged time of warfare and strife, eventually consolidating power into five different kingdoms]]: [[Gallacão]], [[Iberys]], [[Andaluz]], [[Gharve]] and [[Umayyad]]. The conflicts between these [[Five Kingdoms of Man]] have largely defined the Third Age.

# Geography

Though small comparative to other continental land masses, Amalthea occupies around 90,000 square kilometers, spread across its primary mainland and surrounding islands. The total coastline of the continent measures roughly 3,400 kilometers, including the estimated distance of the uncharted region of [[An-Talamh]]. The character of the coastline varies with the character of the environment that surrounds it; which ranges from rocky and foreboding, to the silver sands of [[Iberys]] famous [[Glass Coast]].

Largely, the geography of Amalthea was the greatest factor that informed the shaping of the Kingdoms of Man, with mountains and rivers creating natural barriers. As such, each of the five regions have generally distinct features and climates that make them unique. These regions vary drastically from the endless dunes of the [[Umayyad]] desert, the lush mountainous terrain of [[Gallacão]] or the rolling green hills of [[Gharve]] or the barren and unforgiving plains of [[Andaluz]].

The highest known point in Amalthea at a height of 3,200 meters is [[Serra Arbusto]], which houses the secluded village of [[Zeryne]]. Other notable ranges include the [[Kasmanium Range]] in Northern Gallacão, with its highest peak [[Serra da Verra Alto]] reaching 2,100 meters and the [[Cinturão Divino]] - the longest mountain range in Amalthea - which stretches from Northern Umayyad, Southeastern Andaluz and into central Iberys. 

Amalthea also includes a number of archipelagos and small islands, most notably [[Riffia]], which is a rocky, uninhabited chain of islands off the southern coasts of Gharve and Umayyad, which creates the safe harbor of the Blackram Gulf, giving the waters their characteristic stillness and brilliant clarity. About 830 kilometers into the [[Vascuma Ocean]], due west from the port city of [[Luavila]], lies [[Ilha Selvagem]], a mysterious settlement situated in the crater of a long-dormant volcano.

The northern-most territory on the continent is An-Talamh, which, due to the uncertain angle described in The [[Treaty of Oisín]], belongs to the elder races. As such, very few humans have ventured beyond its border, and little is known of the geography, cities, people or resources. In fact, it has been so long since any human has ventured farther north than the Kasmanium Mountains that the existence of the northern realm has come under scrutiny, and is believed by some scholars to be propaganda of a long passed age that is considered to be true only in that it has not yet been disproven. An-Talamh is said to be protected by a powerful spell that makes it impossible to enter without first being invited.

Additionally, the fabled land of [[Hy-Brasyl]], home of the Tuatha, is said to lie off the eastern coast of Gallacão and should "*be apparent to the eye from any point along the waters edge, beckoning only to the those bearing a tremendous heart, chosen by the weavers of fate to dwell in eternal paradise*". Other sources claim it appears only once every 800 years for a matter of hours, with accounts written of a fantastic civilization much advanced in culture and technology, so wealthy that the pavers are inlaid with golden detail. A number of alleged witnesses to the existence of this realm have given differing accounts of the geography throughout the ages. In the modern age there have been no credible sightings of this kingdom, though most cartographers still include the landmass out of tradition, perhaps owing to a suppressed sense of whimsy in a profession that deals strictly with fact.
