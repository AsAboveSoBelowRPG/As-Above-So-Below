In Amalthean mythology, the Divine twins, [[Nuaré]] and [[Bánsolas]], are known as the Lightbringers for vanquishing their father Smoladh and freeing the world from his oppressive darkness. 

# Birth of the Divine Twins
During the [[Time of Chaos]], the Queen Goddess Sadhbh saw a prophecy that she would give birth to two children that would vanquish the tyranny of Smoladh, Lord of Darkness. Sadhbh laid with Smoladh in his palace of despair. As prophesized, she conceived twins from this union and sought to hide the pregnancy from her vengeful consort. Venturing far from the Cthonic realm from which Smoladh ruled, Sadhbh returned to her kingdom in the sky to give birth, hiding the the infant twins behind a giant silver shield. 

She named the firstborn child, a boy, Nuaré, and tasked the child with supporting the weight of the shield behind which they hid. The second child she named Bánsolas, for she shimmered with the light of hope. Sadhbh had to return to the Cthonic realm, lest Smoladh notice her absence and become suspicious. In her absence the children grew and matured, and as they did, so, too, did their light. Though they concealed themselves behind the shield of the moon, [[Gealach]], each day the twins grew more luminescent until they could no longer hide their light.

# Luxomachy
From the gates of the underworld, a luminous ring appeared in the sky like a flaming eye. Smoladh immediately understood the deception of his bride, and rallied his siblings, the Primordial Gods, to his side. Each took up arms and ascended to the surface where they waited in awe of the celestial phenomenon. It marked the first time light had ever graced the surface of the world, and to those beings born of darkness, it was terrifying to behold.

In this stupor, the twins left the shelter of the moon and descended upon those foul beings who held dominion over the land. Wielding swords of flames, the two waged war against endless shadows until they carved a path to the emperor of darkness. For 390 days the twins fought against their vile progenitor until at last they vanquished him; banishing him to the realm behind the sky, and sending the rest of the Primordial Gods into exile.

The removal of the oppressive darkness and supplanting it with golden light is referred to as the [[Luxomachy]].

# Anastasis dos Estrelas
During the 400 days that the twins pursued Smoladh, they circumnavigated the entire globe, ending the battle where it first began. As they fought, each time the twins brought their flaming weapons down against the lord of darkness, embers would fly free of their swords. Each of these points of light became a star, and when the Divine Twins banished their father to the realm beyond the sky, those stars sprung to life to keep the darkness at bay. These new gods were called the Celestials, and can be seen patrolling the night sky when darkness is at its most powerful.

The birth of the Celestial Pantheon is celebrated in the Five Kingdoms as the [[Festa do Anastasis]], the most holy day for those who worship the Old Gods.
