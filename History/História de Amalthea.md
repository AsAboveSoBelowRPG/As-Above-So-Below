Understanding the history of important events through the ages of Amalthea is sometimes best understood by looking at a timeline. As such, this timeline was compiled with dates to the best of the understanding of the scholars at [[Quatrograde]].

Years are measured first by age, then by the year within, so the year 0'0 would be the dawn of the universe, with 1'0 being the dawn of the first age etc. There are three major eras of history in [[Amalthea]]: The [[Time of Chaos]], [[The Common Light]] and [[The Modern World]], though these are often simply referenced sequentially as the First, Second and Third Ages.

# First Age

The first age occupies a dark period of history almost inconceivably deep in the past that all dates listed are strictly hypothetical, and extrapolated from religious texts that are often contradictory. Specific years are to be taken as approximations in this era.

# Second Age

The second age is thought to have lasted approximately 26,000 years, beginning after the [[Time of Chaos]] and ending with the modern age.
