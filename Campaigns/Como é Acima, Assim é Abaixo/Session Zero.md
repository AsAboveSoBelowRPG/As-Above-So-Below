> *Along the southern coast of the continent of [[Amalthea]], the ancient city of [[Porto Coelbren]] is poised to become a new hub of trade and prosperity for the kingdom of [[Gharve]]. Though the city has been renovated for the modern age, the history lurking below the surface threatens to shatter the future of this seaside paradise.*

# Setting

Amalthea is, as far as its inhabitants are aware, the entirety of the known world. Occasionally expeditions are mounted to explore the world beyond the shores, but few return - those who do are irreparably shattered, trapped in a state of madness. Some strange travelers claim to have come from other lands; even other realms, but these claims are approached with great suspicion and doubt.

The mainland of the continent is defined by five kingdoms and one land that is accessible only to those who descend from the ancient races that once occupied the land, before the uprising of man threw the world into chaos. As a whole, Amalthea is based loosely on the culture and geography of the Iberian Peninsula. 

- Gharve, where our adventure begins, represents a land similar to the Iberian between the 6th - 8th century; indigenous culture is present, but fading and the prolonged war between Gharve and Umayyad has rendered the frontier cities as unique entities untethered from the culture of their ruling nation. 

- Neighboring to the East is the [[Umayyad]] Empire, which represents life under the Moorish rule, and shares a geography similar to northern Africa, the Mediterranean and Turkey. It is the largest of the five kingdoms.

- [[Iberys]], along the western coast in central Amalthea, is the prosperous kingdom that mirrors Central Portugal. The city of [[Luavila]] representing a pre-earthquake Lisboa and the city of [[Sagacidade]] hosting the grand university of [[Quatrograde]]. The coastline is an endless beach of clear sand, aptly known as the [[Glass Coast]].

- The northernmost city is [[Gallacão]], which is a mountainous and largely unruly kingdom where life is challenging and, outside of the capital city of [[Salasandra]], is mostly a collection of small settlements dedicated to etching out a humble existence from what the land allows them.

- Lastly, you find [[Andaluz]] along the eastern coast. The vast and rolling grasslands stretch over rolling hills, and is reminiscent of the western lands of Spain that boarder Portugal; from the Estremadura to Galicia.

- The land of [[An-Talamh]] is the northern-most land in Amalthea and exists as a result of a faltering in the drawing of boarders by the human conqueror [[Oisín Desterro]], who led a revolt against the elder races and sought to banish them to the [[Cthonic Remains]] below the surface. As he swept his hand across the land, an injury sustained in the war caused him to flinch as he passed over the north, accidentally granting it to magical and indigenous people of Amalthea. The have since sealed the realm from human intervention. It is a land of magic and mystery that represents Gaelic Ireland, which the indigenous tribes of Iberia fled to from Northern Portugal and Spain.

- Island colonies exist around the mainland, with [[Ilha Selvagem]] serving as an analog for the Azores. The [[Riffia]] archipelago is a craggy and inaccessible stretch of islands that defy exploration. Included on most maps, but only based on myths is the holy paradise of [[Hy-Brasyl]], based on Irish legends of a continent that only appears occasionally.

# Culture

Our adventure begins in the year 3'1045 (Third Age, 1045), during a time of general stability between the [[Five Kingdoms of Man]]. With the enduring struggle of a relentless war now behind them, humanity has been able to put their attention towards rebuilding and improving the lives of the citizenry. However, just because the war has found an uneasy truce doesn't mean the kingdoms aren't still competing - Gharve and Umayadd are in a race to establish economic supremacy. 

This conflict can be best understood by the means through which these kingdoms seek their fortune: the people of Umayadd are largely nomadic and have an established trade route that spans the entire country called the [[Rua Sedazul]] - basically the silk road. Gharve, on the other hand, looks to the sea to establish trade routes using the high risk/high reward method of nautical dominance.

Despite the rivalry, this unprecedented time of peace between the former waring nations has lead to a time of great cooperation. Travelers and merchants enjoy the benefits of open borders and the royalty have extended great diplomacy in the interim; seeing the economic race as a bit of friendly rivalry.

# Religion

Despite mankind rising up to vanquish the [[Tuatha]], the children of the Gods, they still carry devotion to the [[Gods]] which are very involved in the lives of the mortals. There is a complicated heiarchy of pantheons; the oldest of which are the [[Primordial Gods]] and the [[Celestials]]; representing both darkness and light - the realm above and that below. The children of the Celestials, the [[Danu]] conquered the oppressive children of darkness, the [[Cthonic Gods]] and brought light to the world, starting the Second Age.

Worship of the dark gods happens in secret, leading to the establishment of dark cults, whereas gods from the pantheons of Light have numerous temples and monuments across the land. Still, others prefer to worship local, rustic deities that are tied to specific locations by virtue of their grace, protection and elemental blessings.

The most important event in the mythology of Amalthean religion is the story of [[The Lightbringers]]; the twin gods conceived by the captive sky goddess [[Sadhbh]] and the corpse of her fallen consort [[Gréine]]. The twins, [[Nuaré]] of the Moon and [[Bánsolas]] of the Sun, were raised in secret in the realm of the sky, and, once they came of age, descended to the material plane to vanquish [[Smoladh]], the lord of darkness, and his offspring. Once light declared victory over darkness, the Cthonic gods were banished to toil beneath the surface, where they still exist to this day -- save for Smoladh, who was exiled to the realm beyond the stars.

# Coelbren

Our adventure starts in the city of [[Porto Coelbren]], an ancient city that has recently become an anchor for the kingdom of Gharve's plans to establish a network of coastal ports through which they can attain great wealth and secure their position as the premier seat of trade in Amalthea. As such, representatives from the [[Royal Merchant's Guild]] of the capitol city of [[Toltea]] have invested three years in renovating the city's crumbling infrastructure, quickly turning it into one of the most important nautical ports in the kingdom.

In short order, a number of once-humble fishermen have rose to prominence and wealth through their seats on the city council. While each member has their own motivation and morals, their job of mediating between the good of the citizens and the desires of the government to attain wealth is often swayed by bribes and favors. This conflict between the locals and the rich merchants is developing a rift between the people of Coelbren.

People of all species are found here; from those with distant chthonic lineage, to those who can trace their family history to the [[Tuatha]] who founded the city. No one would lift an eyebrow to see someone from any walk of life - be they dwarf, elf, elemental or even the most exotic of races.

## Factions

Due to the recent circumstances, there are a wide variety of people milling about in Coelbren. Perhaps you have an affiliation with, or belong to, one of these following.

- **Royal Merchants Guild:** investing heavily into city as a burgeoning port of note, seeking to revive trade at sea in attempts to weaken the importance of the Sedazul.
- **Fixers:** Rising from the collapse of the [[Ordem Etérea]], the [[Ordem de Reparação]] is a group of freelance monster hunters that contract with government officials to tackle dangerous beings and ethereal issues. Though the technical term is Reparadores, these individuals are colloquially known as Fixers.
- **Sailors:** All sorts of seafaring folk either call this home, or make it a frequent port of call. Everyone from wealthy merchant ships, humble fishing vessels and even fearsome buccaneers can be found mingling at the docks.
- **Townies:** Locals who are born and raised in the city rarely wander far. Those who are from this ancient city come from a rough stock, and are often mistrusting of outsiders.
- **Clergy:** With the upcoming festival of [[Phaunus]], a great number of zealots belonging to the cult of [[Slint]] - a local deity of indulgence and debauchery - have descended upon the port city. These priests and their followers are tasked with ensuring that the festival is observed appropriately, and that the people of Coelbren are appropriately compelled to participate in the tradition.
- **City Council:** Boasting representatives from each of the factions, the City Council rules Coelbren by committee, since the dismissal of the city's warden.

## Current Events

These events help set the backdrop for life in and around Coelbren. While some of these may not directly impact the lives of your characters, they are very much influencing the lives of the people around you - either directly or indirectly.

- Since 3'1042, a contingency from the Gharve capital office of the Merchant's guild have been present in the city by mandate of the King, making an effort to improve the facilities and attract more attention to the city as a hub of trade. Three years later, the city has been nearly transformed from a forgotten outpost to a glimmering gem along the southern coast.
- The increased prosperity of Coelbren has attracted the unwanted attention of marauders from the sea. Famous buccaneer [[Bejar the Destroyer]] has demanded ransom from the city council. Until the demanded sum has been delivered, he has set up a blockade of the waters off the coast.
- The status of the former warden of Coelbren, [[Marcelino Barbosa]] remains uncertain. After being removed from office and replaced by the [[The Council of Six]], he retreated to his manor and hasn't been seen in 3 years. Rumors have started to circulate about strange phenomenon occurring in and around the estate.
