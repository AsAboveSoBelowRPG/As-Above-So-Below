Situated in the subterranean ruins of the [[Castelo Dubvane]] is the Templo Desmofado, a forbidden shrine to [[Múnla]], the Cthonic god of Decay. Worship of the [[Cthonic Gods]] was outlawed at the dawn of the Third Age, though traditions date back before recorded history, and there is an unbroken lineage of those who participate in the mysteries associated with these ancient deities.

# Leadership and Clergy

For over a century, the temple has been lead by the high priest [[Ivan Eliphas]], who's failing health has lead to an internal struggle for power between his two proteges - [[Leannan Runda]] who carries a more holistic view of Múnla's role in the cycle of life, and the brooding [[Omner Do Mortae]] who has [[Éachtach|Éachtachian]] beliefs that decay and death exist outside of any other external influence.

This conflict has engulfed the small temple, with every member taking sides and preparing for a potentially violent struggle for control when Eliphas passes away.

# Beliefs

For most of history, worshipers of Múnla carried the reputation of being sympathizers of the [[Primordial Gods]], who wish to see the world restored to darkness and to reverse the banishment of [[Smoladh]]. This general belief carried for thousands of years until Eliphas, a priest with a gentler view of Lord Múnla's role in the world rose to the position of High Priest. Though his influence has brought enlightenment to the congregation, his views are still in the minority.

## Éachtachian Worship

The misconception that Decay is the realm of death worship under the hardline view of Múnla as a element of a malicious trinity: Éachtach, Smoladh and Múnla -- Death, Darkness and Decay. A cornerstone of this branch believes that it was only by the absence of decay in the [[Time of Chaos]] that [[The Lightbringers]] were able to bring ruin to the rule of darkness; if [[Gréine]] had been devoured by decay, the divine twins wouldn't have been able to mature behind his lifeless body.

While these worshipers place the god in a pantheon of darkness, not all have desires to see the world return to this state. Éachtachian extremists, however, believe that through strengthening the worship of this trinity, the Cthonic forces will be able to rally and overthrow the [[Danu]] and the [[Celestials]]. 

## Ciclean Worship

A much gentler approach to the worship of Múnla that sees him in an eternal cycle opposite the Danu god [[Raidhse]], the god of nature. As things bloom and flourish, they must also face mortality and death. Through decay, the world is made fertile, allowing once more for birth and abundance.

This ethos is controversial, both with the followers of the Danu and with those who worship the Primordials, as neither side particularly likes to acknowledge a synergistic collaboration between the pantheons. Once a fringe belief in the temple, it has since become widely adopted when High Priest Eliphas converted to the Ciclean philosophy.
