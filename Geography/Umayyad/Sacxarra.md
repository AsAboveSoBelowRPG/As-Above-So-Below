Sacxarra is a massive underground necropolis where the royal families of [[Al-Khreiss]] are interred. The elaboratly carved entrance of the tomb is guarded by two sphinxes, [[Aelaus]] and [[Noset]]. Though entry is forbidden for those outside of the [[Umayyad]] royalty and the clergy of the royal city, rumors persist that this tomb serves as an entrance to the [[Cthonic Remains|Underworld]].
