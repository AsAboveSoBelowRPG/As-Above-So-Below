Before [[The Common Light]], in the [[Time of Chaos]], the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial God]] [[Smoladh]], the Lord of Darkness, built his vast kingdom underground, hidden from the realm of the sky. This grim kingdom was known as the Cthonic Realm.

After [[The Lightbringers]] [[Nuaré]] and [[Bánsolas]] ushered in [[The Common Light]], the [[Primordial Gods]] sought refuge in the Cthonic ruins where no light could find them, hiding amongst the shadows. Later, after the [[Treaty of Oisín]], many of the elder races also descended to these ruins.

During the Third Age, the Cthonic Remains have become a harbor for vile and wicked beings that emerge in the night to bring pain and sadness to those who dwell under the realm of the sky.
