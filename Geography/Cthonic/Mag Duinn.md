Mag Duinn is a subterranian realm within the [[Cthonic Remains]]. While it has existed since the [[Time of Chaos]], the realm was changed irreparably when it was invaded by the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic]] [[Nazerack]] during his destruction of the [[Castelo Ayodar]]. Like a pest introducing foreign diseases to an untouched land, the ancient God contaminated this sheltered realm with cultures from the [[Upper Sphere]] and, furthermore, connected it to the greater Remains as it tunneled through. As such, Mag Duinn has become a stopping point for those capable of travelling between the mortal realm and the underworld.

# Culture

Having remained largely untouched, even after the intrusion of Nazerack, Mag Duinn is a simple land that exists in a strange half-light, as the sun filters through the tunnel carved by the descent of the ancient God. Life in Mag Duinn is pastoral and rustic, with small villages loosely connected through large swaths of dangerous woodlands. As such, most villages are forced to be entirely self sufficient and have settled into simple lives of modest means and agriculture.

While most people in Mag Duinn don't aspire for more than a comfortable existence, they are highly superstitious and hold fast to a religion that predates the catastrophic intrusion. The old ways remain the primary belief of the lands and owes worship to the nature goddess [[Nespera]]. In recent years, these established beliefs have been challenged by new cults that now spread from village to village.

- [[The Ashen Bough]]: The formalized religion of The Old Ways, which are as unchanging as the land itself.
- [[The Groundskeepers]]: An offshoot of The Old Ways which opts to worship only the gentle aspects of nature. 
- [[The Children of the Flame]]: Worshippers of light that believe Mag Duinn was intentionally plunged into darkness to atone for some ancient sin.
- [[The Taciturn Lot]]: Not an organized religion, but those who embrace logic and fact over superstition and religion are often mockingly referred to under this moniker.
