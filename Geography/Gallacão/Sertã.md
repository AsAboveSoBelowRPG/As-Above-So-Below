Outside the imposing walls of the Royal City of [[Salasandra]], beyond the sprawl of shanties and slums that vie for the protection the shadow of the capital provides, at the edge of the [[Rio Zêzere]] lies the quaint village of Sertã. Often the last glimpse of civilization adventurous souls experience when they embark on the rugged [[Kasman Road]], Sertã specializes in catering to the traveler, boasting a number of inns, taverns and outfitters all geared at equipping those brave souls with the best odds of survival.
