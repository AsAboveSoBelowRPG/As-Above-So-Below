Coelbren is a region in south eastern [[Gharve]]; nestled between the hills of [[Monserra]] and the coast of the [[Abismo de Março]].  Though it is a small region, it hosts a varied and diverse landscape. The district, which presents evidence of inhabitation since early in the second age, still serves as an important population center for the kingdom of Gharve.

# Cities of Coelbren

Though there are only a few population centers in the region, Coelbren is host to a number of settlements and cities:

## Porto Coelbren

The capitol of the district is [[Porto Coelbren]], after which the region was named. After the end of the war between the kingdom of Gharve and the [[Umayyad]] Empire, the city was redeveloped from a modest fishing village into a thriving trade city.

## Porta Vicentia

A small fishing village that developed in the late days of the second age. It was being considered for redevelopment after the peace accord with Umayadd was reached, but a hurricaine which destroyed the docks and left the city in ruin encouraged the Royal Merchant's Guild to, instead, put all their effort into Coelbren.

## Charlun

A city that sprung up along the [[Rio Azedo]] and was once considered to be an important settlement, however the creeping corruption of the nearby [[Spongewald Wastes]] spread to the lands surrounding the city and forced its inhabitants to evacuate. It now sits abandoned as the swamp slowly devours the buildings.

## Laramae

North of Porto Coelbren, across the Azedo, is a small settlement that sprung up after the redevelopment of the capitol, when suddenly poor farmers and fishermen could no longer afford the cost of living. The attitude towards the people of Coelbren is hostile.

## Roston

Defiantly situated inside the Spongewald, this settlement is inhabited by a rough and hardy population of people who have adapted to life in the corrupted marsh. Not many bother to visit this distant and forsaken place, though it does have a tavern to welcome the weary traveler.

# Geographic Features

The natural features in Coelbren are a wonderous mix of stunning beauty and aggressive danger. Because of the inherent danger of the surrounding areas, much of the district remains unexplored and uncharted. As such, many stories and legends exist that have never been verified by reliable sources.

## Serra Das Garras

The setting for the legend of the famed wizard [[Neferu the Timewalker]], who was said to have been given his tremendous powers by an ancient elemental god, whom he then petrified, frozen forever in stone. Though these stories are typically dismissed as nothing more than myth and legend, the [[Serra Das Garras]] is still considered to be sacred to many who inhabit the region.

## Sarcasomera

A forest so dense that, at its heart, no light penetrates the canopy. As such, it has proven nearly impossible to navigate; both because of the impenetrable darkness, but also because of the vicious denizens of the woods, which seem to crawl their way from the depths. A tower can be seen from the periphery of the cursed woods, but none have ever managed to navigate to its entrance.

## Lagoa Skathanha

Once a life-giving source of pride to the people of the Coelbren district, this lake was home to a [[Nereid]] of the same name for centuries. At some point, however, the lake was poisoned by a powerful curse, and now its putrid waters spread the corruption to anything it touches. This creeping danger threatens to destroy all of Coelbren, given enough time.

## Shiverspine

This ancient forest of enormous cedars was said to have been planted by the [[Tuatha]] at the first dawn. In all of Amalthea, this is only place this particular tree is known to grow; though they produce razor sharp needles, the nuts from the cones they drop are coveted for their culinary, healing and esoteric properties. Because of the danger presented by the foliage, and from the creatures that dwell within, these nuts are very scarce and fetch a high price on the open market.

## Spongewald Wastes

One of the largest ecosystems in Coelbren, the [[Spongewald Wastes]] are a sprawling swamp that continues to grow as the cursed waters of the [[Ladoa Skathanha]] feed it. Wherever the damp soil spreads, it brings with it a plethora of disease, famine and dangerous vermin. The threat of the wastes is always on the minds of those who dwell in the Coelbren district.

# Ancient Wonders

Throughout the district, there are a great many ruins and structures that date far back into prehistory. Some of these are merely legends, but have graced maps of the region for hundreds of years - these are still included despite cartographers best efforts to discover which of them exist and which are simply myth.

## Templo Da Zelica

The gilded fortress of the warrior goddess [[Zelica]] is rumored to have been located in the region of Coelbren. Historians typically place it somewhere in either the [[Shiverspine]] or the [[Spongewald Wastes]]; cartographers have started to place it along the border of both, since there aren't even any second-hand accounts in the modern age of explorers stumbling across this structure.

## Torre do Davi

Famed alchemist [[Davi de Malad]] supposedly used his salary from the royal court of Gharve to fund the construction of this tower, which is said to sit directly on top of a font of magical power. Rumors say that the spire acts as an amplification device that can focus this collected magical energy, but for what purpose, none can say. Though the tower can be seen from many points in the district, the spreading wastes have rendered it inaccessible.

## Ruínas de Deremaz

Deremaz, during the war, was a stronghold build by the kingdom of Gharve. It was said to have housed a large magical laboratory in the cellar, which was of great concern to the Umayadd Empire, who sent a great force to destroy the fortress. The general refused to leave until the bombardment reduced the structure to rubble.

## Cromlech do Deus Quebrado

One of the most defining structures in Coelbren is the massive Cromlech that sits atop a hill above the city. One of the largest such structures, which still stands in remarkable shape. The only thing missing is the central statue, of which only boots remain. The identity of this missing God has long been one of the most enduring mysteries for the people of this district.
