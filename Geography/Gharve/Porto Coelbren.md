Coelbren is a humble fishing village situated along the eastern coast of [[Gharve]]  on the [[Abismo de Março]] in the [[Coelbren (Region)|district that bears its name]]. Though Coelbren is a quiet seaside city, it has a long history that predates the establishment of the five kingdoms of man. In recent eras, Coelbren was marked as a potential hub for trade and commerce by the king of Gharve, and was developed by the [[Royal Merchant's Guild]], which invested heavily in the city's renaissance. This rewnewed prosperity has lead to a growing conflict between the wealthy merchant class and the poor locals, who are slowly being displaced by the growing wealth. 

# History
Believed to have been established as an ancient port during the early Second Age at the behest of the seafaring [[Bastuli]] people. Inscriptions in some of the ancient buildings read that the construction of the oldest part of the village was commissioned by the Bastuli and constructed by the dwarven masons of the nearby [[Serra Arbusto]]. By these records, it appears that the oldest center of the city was completed around the year 2'0155; making it one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in [[Amalthea]].

Curiously, the same inscription implies that the same stonemasons were also conscripted to assist in the settlement of a nearby island between Coelbren and the [[Riffia Archipelago]], though this location has either been lost to time or was never completed. 

Though the Bastuli inhabited the city for thousands of years, their numbers eventually dwindled until their culture was lost; what was left of their people eventually integrated into other tribes. During this time, Coelbren became a hub of trade and a refuge for those travelling by sea; it was a time of great prosperity - thought to rival the economic success of the original inhabitants.

During the mid-to-late Second Age the nearby cities of [[Filomena]] and [[Faraon]] grew in size and importance, and overland passage began to prove safer and more effective as trade routes, which eventually made Coelbren a city of little significance. It remained this way until the Third Age brought border disputes to the land, causing the city to frequently change hands between the [[Umayyad]] empire and [[Gharve]].  Centuries of war kept the frontier city in a constant state of flux, suffering frequent raids and occupations by both kingdoms.

Since the singing of the peace accords between the two nations, Coelbren has been given an opportunity to flourish, especially with the monetary backing of the capitol city. This rapid shift from subsistence farmers and grizzled fishermen to wealthy merchants has caused a dramatic shift for the inhabitants, and the conflict between the old and the new.

# Government

During the war with Umayyad, the [[Coelbren (Region)|District of Coelbren]] was governed by a warden, primarily in the interest of making decisions based on military strategy and defense. This role was last served by General [[Marcelino Barbosa]] before the King dismissed this position in favor of regional committee in the year 3'1042.

Now, Coelbren is governed by [[The Council of Six]]; elected representatives that make policy together in the interest of their constituents. Though many decry the council as corrupt mouthpieces for those with enough money to sway opinions, most agree that they are better represented with a menagerie of personalities rather than a single voice. 

# Economy

Most of Coelbren's economy comes from the sea; be it through trade or fishing. Its position along the Gharve coast in the [[Abismo de Março]] makes it a prime location for catching exotic fish that are considered culinary delights. 

In addition to the calm, warm waters of the gulf, the sea is further protected by the [[Riffia Archipelago]]. This safe harbor has made it a very popular port-of-call for merchant vessels. As such, many wealthy traders have made their home in Coelbren, marking it as one of the wealthiest cities in the kingdom.

Despite the post-war prosperity of Coelbren, the locals who struggled through generations of endless war still face extreme poverty as the city grows larger, attracting many foreign settlers. Balancing the lifestyles of those suffering from income inequality is a constant concern for the Council.

# Neighborhoods

The city of Porto Coelbren is divided into seven different neighborhoods, each of which offers a different flavor of life. As the city continues to gentrify, these districts are in a state of flux, with the poorer areas being increasingly absorbed by the affluent population.

## Bairro do Mercado

The northern-most neighborhood is the Bairro do Mercado; a market district that has sprung up around the Merchant's Guild. Though there are a number of specialized shops, the most impressive feature of the neighborhood is the Grand Bazar, an open air market where itinerant merchants gather to sell their wares from colorful tents and stalls. 

Some notable shops and vendors include:
- [[Royal Merchant's Guild|Merchant's Guild Hall]]: One of the largest buildings in Porto Coelbren, the guild hall occupies a former palace built by the former Duke of [[Coelbren (Region)|Coelbren]]. This building also serves as the administrative center of the city, hosting [[The Council of Six]].
- Mãe do Madeira: Colloquially known as The Woodwitch, [[Odessa Delacroix]] is an eccentric woman with an affinity for rare types of wood, which she uses as reagents for her spellwork.
- Líquido Corajoso: Though he has been plying his trade for decades, the alchemist [[Hadi Chafik]] hasn't yet mastered the craft of alchemy. As such, his potions are often flawed - causing many adventurers to avoid his wares. 
- [[Maré Cheia]]: A large tent of reeds and driftwood houses Coelbren's fish market. Here, a number of lively vendors sell their daily catch as the compete for customers. The stall also contains an ancient shrine to a forgotten [[Naiad]] from the times before the water elementals abandoned the region.
- Fates & Forecasts: An exotic fortune teller named [[Luminestra]] offers her oracular gifts to those who seek her council; typically superstitious sailors about to embark on long or difficult journeys.
- Recompensa do Orient: A small stall specializing in rugs and textiles imported from the far east of the [[Umayyad]]. Run by an unpleasant merchant, [[Cosme Neira]],  who sees the word 'no' as a personal insult.
- Spice of Life: Though he keeps his sources closely guarded, [[Thomas Priexa]] carries a wild and exotic selection of rare and expensive spices. Some claim he has ties to criminal syndicates in Umayyad, as he always seems to have information for sale, as well as spice.
- Goode and Sons Sailcraft: Praised for his ingenuity in turning scraps of sailcloth into an enterprise, [[Samuel Goode]] started sourcing odd cuts of sail cloth from the weaveworks and repurposing it into viable products. Ironically, Samuel has only a single daughter, [[Jesca Goode|Jesca]].
- Notário Oficial: [[Joanna Quadro]] serves as a public notary; reviewing, penning, verifying, dictating - basically anything to do with the written word. She also sells parchment, papers, ink and books. She is said to be the most intelligent person in Porto Coelbren.
- Tooth and Nail: A haggard old woman, [[Tilda Saiavedra]], buys and sells odds and ends -shark teeth, shells, pelts and such - out of a small stall; though her real business is in the trading of favors, which don't come cheap.

## Dockside

The largest and, aside from the Market District, busiest neighborhood in Porto Coelbren. Dockside is the beating heart of the city, as all trade begins and ends on the shaky old piers of the waterfront. Dockside stretches along the length of Coelbren's coastline, extending out into the calm blue waters to welcome the arrival of countless vessels, both day and night.

Though this neighborhood is mostly comprised of warehouses and cheap housing for laborers, there are a few points of interest that draw crowds among the many visiting explorers.

- [[O Mundo Perdido]]: The grandson of a [[Johan Valente|master cartographer]], [[Felipe Valente]] has inherited the adventurous explorer's shop and library. Though he has no talent himself, he has made a humble living producing hand drawn copies of the maps compiled by the late Johan - even though they are terribly out of date and inaccurately copied.
- [[Martelo de Fusão]]: This Dockside forge is run by master blacksmith [[Gil Salazar]], and produces tools, nails and other commodities employed by the shipyards and sailors of the port.
- [[The Weaveworks]]:  An emporium of fabric and fibers needed for sailing vessels of all sizes. On site artisans provide the fines robes and sailcloth, as well as embroidery and dyes for flags and uniforms.
- [[Veleiro Yards]]: A large, well-established shipyard in Porto Coelbren, known across the coast for their professionalism, precision, and dependable craftsmanship. Specializing in the sale, commissioning, and repair of ships, the Yards handle everything from merchant vessels to naval contracts with unmatched efficiency. Crewed by skilled artisans and seasoned laborers, the operation runs like clockwork—making it a cornerstone of the city’s maritime reputation.
