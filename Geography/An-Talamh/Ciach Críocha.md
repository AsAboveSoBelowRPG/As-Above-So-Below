The Ciach Cr√≠ocha is a peninsula charted along the western coast of the mythical land of [[An-Talamh]]. Though it has been mapped in location and general size by seafaring cartographers, any attempt to land and mount an expedition have been fruitless.

The few sailors who have sailed far enough north to get a glimpse of the northern coast report an eerie, heavy fog blanketing the peninsula, even when the weather doesn't seem permissive to create such dense cover.

Though sailors are often prone to superstition, even scholars and cartographers that chartered passage to the waters reported a sense of dread and an inability to make precise measurements. As such, attempts to make a survey of the coast have largely been abandoned.
