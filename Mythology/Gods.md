Gods are beings with divine heritage, most of which claim a certain domain over a concept, location or activity owing to their strengths and talents. These beings are often worshiped by those they impact, though some are so old and obscured by the events of a changing world that they have become forgotten. Worship or shrines built in reverence of Gods thought to bring pain, destruction or death to the mortal realm are sometimes even forbidden, with worshipers of particularly maligned Gods being executed or tortured for their sinister prayers.

In a land as old as [[Amalthea]], certain Gods or groupings of Gods called a 'Pantheon' have risen in power,  fallen out of favor or even considered to have become extinct by becoming entirely forgotten, transmuting into a new being, sacrificing themselves or by being slain by another divine being. These pantheons are best understood chronologically, starting with the oldest of the known Gods, which are referred to as the [[Primordial Gods]].

It is believed that the divine beings largely abandoned the land of Amalthea by ascending the [[Serra Arbusto]] as they moved to the realm of the sky, once sacred to [[Sadhbh]]. As they passed through they trusted the dwarven inhabitants of [[Zeryne]] as the guardians of heaven and entrusted those present with immortality and gave them dominion over the [[Repha'im]] and the [[Intxisu]]; two clans of ferocious giants that still roam the sacred mountain to this day. As such, few have made it to the fabled city and none have proven successful in following the ascent of the gods to the sky realm.

# Pantheons
The relations of Gods are best understood by grouping them into Pantheons, which are akin to divine generations, or groupings of specific divine beings. These are generally traced chronologically through what is known of history through antiquity or legend.

## Primordial Gods
The oldest pantheon of Gods in Amalthea are referred to as [[Primordial Gods]], which came into being by the shattering of the Divine Unity at the dawn of the [[Time of Chaos]]. These Gods ruled over vast dominions, as most of the world had yet to come into being. The two most powerful Gods of this age were [[Smoladh]], the God of Darkness who sought to rule the realms both above and below by wedding the Goddess of the sky. Sequestering the rest of the Primordials in the [[Cthonic Remains|Cthonic Realm]] beneath the surface where his influence was strongest. Some of the most prominent Primordial Gods are:

- [[Smoladh]]; God of Darkness, ruler of the underworld.
- [[Éachtach]]; Firstborn of Smoladh, the God of Death who finally ended the suffering of the wounded [[Gréine]].
- [[Anallód]]; Second son of Smoladh, the God of Time.
- [[Anordú]]; The third of the [[Primordial Blights]] and favored son of Smoladh, God of Violence.
- [[Xadul]]; Primordial god of Chaos, said to have been the one to shatter the Divine Unity.

## The Danu
Lead by the twin children of [[Sadhbh]], the Lighbringers, the [[Danu]] overthrew the tyrannical rule of the Primordials and brought light to the world. During the rule of the Danu, the world was ushered into the Second Age, or [[The Common Light]]. It was also during their reign that the [[Tuatha]] came into being.

- [[Nuaré]]; The Twin of the Moon, elder sibling of the Lightbringers who banished their oppressor [[Smoladh]] to the realm beyond the sky.
- [[Bánsolas]]; The Twin of the Sun, only daughter of [[Sadhbh]]. 
- [[Matórm]]; the god of masculinity. His entitlement and strength often leads him to take what he wishes by force or through deception. It is said that those who wrestle with him are to be blessed with uncanny strength.
- [[Raidhse]]; the goddess of Nature.
- [[Bástea]]; the goddess of Rain and mother of the [[Nymph]], [[Naiad]] and [[Nereid]]. One of the few gods capable of travelling freely between the realm of the sky, the terrestrial world and the [[Cthonic Remains]]; often serves as a messenger between the various pantheons.
- [[Ulliam]]; the God of music. Oldest son of [[Fedelm]].

## Celestial Gods
When the [[Divine Unity]] shattered, some of the shards were scattered deep into the sky realm, and existed there under the leadership of their leader Gréine. Entirely unaware of the chaos and strife below the surface of [[Amalthea]], the [[Celestials]] were caught entirely unaware when [[Smoladh]] lead his forces into the sky realm and slayed the God of the Sun. 

These astral beings cared for [[The Lightbringers]] when [[Sadhbh]] hid them in the sky realm.

- [[Gréine]]; God of the Sun, slain by the Primordial Smoladh.
- [[Sadhbh]]; Goddess of the Sky, forced to wed Smoladh after the defeat of the Sun.
- [[Fedelm]]; the Goddess of prophecy. She has seen the beginning and the end of all known realms.
- [[Priosma]]; Goddess of rainbows and reflection; said to be an artisan of light, able to weave it as a seamstress works fabric.

## Elemental and Rustic Gods
During [[The Common Light]] many divine beings were born across Amalthea. Orders of elemental gods sprung up to bring life and beauty to the world; [[Nymph|Nymphs]], [[Naiad|Naiads]] and [[Nereid|Nereids]] brought water to the world, the [[Dryad|Dryads]] saw the world bloom and flourish. Some important Rustic Gods include:

- [[Aislinn]]; known as *The Prudent Mother*, Aislinn is a Naiad so beautiful that she drew [[Nuaré]] from his heavenly throne, and together they gave birth to the [[Tuatha]].
- [[Slint]]; Chaotic *God of Indulgence* that is worshipped by those who have a lust for life.
- [[Silhit]]; the playful Naiad that brings water to the spring at the center of the remote village of [[Moradu]].

## Cthonic Gods
[[Cthonic Gods]], the children of Darkness, are the offspring of the banished [[Primordial Gods]]. Though these modern Gods largely share their progenitors domain in the underworld, many of them perform duties in the world at large. 

- [[Dagdromen]]; Trickster God of Illusion that often presents those overcome with greed and jealousy a perilous bargain.
- [[Múnla]]; The God of Decay, who's touch can erode mountains and return the dead to the soil. Largely feared by the living with an unsophisticated understanding of the cycle of life.
- [[Talún]]; the God of Earthquakes and vibration.

# Demigods
When a God mates with a mortal, their offspring is born in a state between the divine and the mundane known as a [[Demigods|Demigod]]. While typically born with a supernatural gift, they are not generally immortal -- though many do not age, they generally can be killed by traditional means. Because of their mortal aspects that allow people to more easily relate to the Demigods, they tend to be quite popular; often moreso than their divine parents. Some famous Demigods include:

- [[Sorbo]]; Son of [[Matórm]] and a beautiful mortal woman [[Luchta]]. Sorbo is a folk hero, popular for his incredible strength and his numerous deeds done for the benefit of the population. His tale is also one of relatable sorrow and compassion.
- [[Zyweith the Hollow]]; born of an unholy union between the Cthonic God of Decay, [[Múnla]], and a maiden set to be sacrificed. Zyweith accumulated a vast wealth of knowledge, which he used to reverse the domain of his half-brother [[Éachtach]] as Amalthea's first Necromancer.

# Other Gods

Strangers have found their way to the shores of [[Amalthea]] claiming to be from some foreign land ruled by strange and exotic gods who have yet to hold dominion in the known land. These people are often dismissed as being mad, being mistaken in their understanding or even of being intentionally deceptive, however, some have come bearing evidence of unknown cultures, lands and practices.

Some of these foreign gods are:
- Torm; a foreign god thought to be a mispronunciation of the name of the god [[Matórm]].
