Born in 2'13,982 in a village known as [[Ádoguia]], said to be somewhere in the [[Bocaterra]], Oisín grew up the son of a humble subsistence farmer that worked the land for a [[Tuatha]] lord. After witnessing the people in his village suffer from poor health, starvation and physical abuse while the wealthy nobility lived lives of luxury, he vowed to overthrow the ruling class and bring equality to his kind.

As an adult he took a stand and struck down the his landlord after he was threatened to be ejected from his home when he couldn't pay an unreasonable harvest tax. He used the moment to lead a rebellion that spread through the land, eventually bringing conflict between the [[Gods]] themselves. Seeking the favor of [[Nuaré]] and [[Bánsolas]], Oisín was permitted to wield the holy weapons The Lightbringers used when they fought against their father, [[Smoladh]]. Thus armed with [[Gealach]] and [[Tintreach]], Oisín waged war against the opposition, facing off against their leader, the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial God]] [[Clábhaín]].

The battle raged for over a decade, and during that time most of the land Oisín swore to protect was destroyed - a fact that he justified by claiming that this sort of oppression would never haunt the land again. The intensity of the battle is said to be what caused the Earth's Maw, which now robs the [[Bastetani Desert]] of its water.

Having come out victorious, Oisín drew the new boundaries of the realm, using his guile to draw the line horizontally, casting the elder races to the land below the bottom of the Bocaterra. However, due to an injury sustained during the battle, his arm flinched as it swept across the north, and the slight deviation carved the kingdom of [[An-Talamh]] out for the Tuatha. In anger, he severed the arm that faltered at the shoulder and cast it into the [[Cthonic Remains|underworld]].

After leading the people to victory, it was expected that Oisín would rule as a fair and just king, however, he claimed that without his arm was not a whole person and, therefore, not fit to lead. As such, the power vacuum left by the banishing of the [[Tuatha]] plunged the world into generations of chaos and war. In the tumult of the balkanization of [[Amalthea]], Oisín quietly vanished and was never confirmed to have been seen again, though rumors persist.

# Controversy

Many historians reject the popular narrative about Oisín being a hero of liberation and instead point to the many historical texts that were contemporaneous with Oisín's life failed to make any coroborating mentions of the village of Ádoguia, nor have there ever been any accounts of a feudalistic society during the Second Age. In fact, written accounts of the Tuatha in Amalthea persist for decades after the supposed banishment took place.

It is also of interest that the only mention of a man named Oisín in this time period comes from a prisoner manifest which lists a transfer of a common thug from a rehabilitation center to a secure facility after he bludgeoned an overseer to death and attempted to flee. These scholars present that Oisín was nothing more than a criminal who staged an uprising. 

Modern theories present that the Tuatha began a northward migration to the land of [[An-Talamh]] of their own accord and the narrative of a human hero overthrowing careless and hostile oppressors was fabricated hundreds of years after the man named Oisín lived, and long after the Tuatha sealed themselves away in the northern lands. What would cause such a myth to arise is vexing, even to those who present this alternative history.

Perhaps the most damning evidence of this alternative event is that the Tuatha are known for their kindness, enlightenment and their stewardship of a peaceful and flourishing environment - and how, without their presence, the land was plunged into chaos, violence and suffering. Additionally, it would seem counter-intuitive for the [[Danu]] to lend their sacred arms to a man who sought to slaughter their children.

# Rumors

Sightings of Oisín have been prevalent since his disappearance. Early accounts by those who knew the man claimed they saw him walking in the presence of luminous beings with a silver arm replacing the one he cast into the underworld. Since then, the image of a silver arm has been the standard of Amalthea.

These alleged sightings always swell in the days leading up to and preceding large and violent battles. It is said that, to see a vision of Oisín on the battlefield foretells a long and bloody war to come. He has become somewhat of a harbinger of doom, though those to whom he appears are assured to emerge victorious. Many draw parallels to the sacrifice he made of his arm, and the great victory for which he paid that price.
