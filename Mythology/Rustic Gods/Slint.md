Slint, sometimes referred to as Slint Shatterhoof, is a [[Rustic God]] of indulgence, celebration and debauchery. His center of worship is in [[Coelbren (Region)|Coerbren]], though his popularity has spread throughout the land due to his domain of pleasures. It has been said that his cult has spread as far north as The [[Lordless Lands]]. 

Slint is a stout and muscular [[Satyr]]; much larger than his mortal counterparts, which sets him apart in art and myth. The symbol of his cult is that of a gourd, based on an old legend that Slint demands an esoteric tribute from his followers, which he keeps stored in a magical gourd.

# Worship

As far as Gods go, worship of Slint is generally not very demanding, but his doctrine invites many pleasures. This has contributed greatly to the spread of his religion. His followers are encouraged to engage in their base desires, and those that are completely free from inhibition are said to be closest to his divine favor.

His cult is far reaching, and it is not uncommon to find shrine or even temples in many rural areas, especially those who rely on the land for their sustenance, as fertility is one of the realms of his influence. Priests in his service generally conduct their holy service in the nude, but can be found outside of the temple wearing ceremonial red robes.

While many are attracted to worship of Slint, as it encourages them to indulge in their favorite vices: sex, food and alcohol - many find that freeing themselves from societal pressures is a more challenging endeavor than expected, and those who are successful are often very different than the person they were at the start.

# Phaunus

The holy celebration [[Phaunus]] is held annually in reverence to Slint. This three-day festival of wine, dancing and sex begins on the first day of [[Athair]]. In rural settings, this typically manifests as a few days of excessive drinking and lovemaking, but the primary festival over which Slint presides at the [[Cromlech do Deus Quebrado]] outside of [[Porto Coelbren]] is often a deadly affair.

During the three day celebration, it is not uncommon for people to drink themselves to death, die of exhaustion from dancing or to see fights erupt between jealous lovers. For the people of the city, the days leading up to Phaunus is a time of great dread.
