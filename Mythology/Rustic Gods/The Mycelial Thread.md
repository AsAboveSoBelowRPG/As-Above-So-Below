The Mycelial Thread is a fringe cult that deviated from the old ways of [[The Ashen Bough]] that posits that the goddess [[Nespera]] is dead, and that nature has become a force of evil in her absence. 

It is the belief of the cultists that, through the perversion of nature and with great sacrifice, the Goddess can be reborn to, once more, hold authority over the underworld realm of [[Mag Duinn]]. How they intend to do this is unknown, as the cult holds their secrets closely, though it is rumored that they have powerful leadership.

Talk of the Mycelial Thread has become akin to the fiction of an urban legend; a cautionary tale to frighten people into devotion to the Old Ways, though, with darkness beginning to eclipse reason in the land, people are beginning to take these stories more seriously.
