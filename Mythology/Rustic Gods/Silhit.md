Silhit is a [[Naiad]] that inhabits a spring in the settlement of [[Moradu]], where she has long been revered as a spirit of abundance and life. Her waters sustain the fertility of the land, which is unusual nestled in the rocky and inhospitable [[Kasmanium Range]]. 

Those who witness Silhit's physical form are enchanted by her breathtaking beauty. Though she is promiscuous with mortals she finds alluring, it is well known among the citizens of the mountain that those who consort with her often turn up dead on the banks of the river. As such, she has a bit of a reputation for being a dangerous deity.

In the year 3'2071 Silhit was almost destroyed when a vengeful [[Kappa]] named [[Woeberus]] engineered a dam to halt her waters at the source. This scheme was discovered and stopped by the [[AAA Fixers For You]] that took a posting to investigate the situation.
