Dagdromen is the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic God]] of Illusion, well known for his deception and sinister deals. Many wise men have found themselves trapped in lives of servitude to this wicked being; others have perished under the weight of their greed.

The only one said to have successfully outwit Dagdromen in one of his sinister bargains is the Necromancer [[Zyweith the Hollow]], who successfully sealed the god away for generations. 

Interestingly, Dagdromen was spotted in [[Amalthea]] outside the northern settlement of [[Moradu]] commissioning weapons and armor in the year 3'2071. If the details of [[The Arsonist|his job posting]] are to be believed, the Cthonic used the smith [[Helder Hall]] to outfit an unseen army. Though he clashed with the [[AAA Fixers For You]], an accord was eventually struck that they part without further violence.

Since this encounter, Dagdromen has not been reported in the lands, so the account of his surfacing is suspect, and must be taken as myth or potentially a false identification.
