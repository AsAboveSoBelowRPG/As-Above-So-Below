Sorbo, Son of [[Matórm]], is a demigod blessed with incredible physical strength. Held as one of the most popular heroes in the history of [[Amalthea]], Sorbo has a tragic story that resonates with the people, making him more relatable and contributing to his popularity. 

# Birth

[[Matórm]], the God of Masculinity, caught sight of the beautiful [[Luchta]]. He desperately wanted to copulate with her, but she had already married a local smith, Helreo. Undeterred, Matórm challenged Helreo to a wrestling match, wagering a night with his wife against his black stallion Joatem. Aware there was no way he could best a God in a wrestling match, Helreo still couldn't pass up the opportunity to spar with the God. Once dispatched, Helreo held his end of the bargain, and slept in the shed. Luchta, however, was not amused when the God informed her of his right to lay with her. Though she protested, she also could not overcome his strength, and she became pregnant with his child.

So disgusted that her husband would wager with her honor, Luchta left her husband and the village behind, travelling south to the bottom of [[Serra Arbusto]]. Wishing to scale the mountain to the heavens and return the child to the God who wronged her, she scarcely made it to the base of the mountain when she went into labor. She sought shelter in a cave, which happened to be the home of [[Réiltín]]. A polymath and healer, the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial God]] centaur helped her give birth, and with it, so too did the fury leave her body. Holding the divine child, she no longer felt the anger and disgust of her violation, but the love of the life she created. Shortly thereafter she died, leaving her child, which she named Sorbo, in Réiltín's care.

The boy was raised along with a number of others who would also grow to become heroes of legend. Though he didn't seem to have a mind for math, literature or herbalism, he was endowed with a physical strength rivaled only the strength of his heart. His compassion with his mentor and peers forgave his simple mind its shortcomings.

# The Slaying of Inaxo

As an adult, Sorbo used his enormous strength to aid the people of [[Gharve]]. His influence in the land was so great that even the king of Gharve, [[King Resheph II]] offered the hand of any of his seven daughters in marriage, putting him in line to ascend to the throne. None of this interested Sorbo, however, for he had fallen deeply in love with with a commoner named [[Inaxo]], and the two wed. Settling into a modest life, the two started a family, though largely a simple existence, they lived joyfully and fully.

During this time, the Governor of [[Faraon]] requested Sorbo's help in ridding the city of a troublesome Cthonic God named [[Dagdromen]] who was causing mischief among the noble class. Dagdromen attempted to lure Sorbo into a bargain that would have made him a puppet to the [[Gods]] dark whims, however, Sorbo's virtues were so strong that he couldn't be tempted by anything he had to offer. Knowing he couldn't match the powerful Sorbo in combat, the Cthonic God retreated to the underworld, but swore he would enact vengeance on the hero.

Aware he couldn't corrupt the legendary hero through material means, Dagdromen used wicked sorcery to send nightmarish visions to haunt Sorbo's mind. The hero believed he was waging war against a powerful beast, when in reality he was lashing out against his loving wife and child. When finally the vision faded and Sorbo was faced with the reality of what he'd done, he put himself into self exile, unable to face the shame and pain he had brought into his life.

# Life of Labours

Having lived years of sequestered torment in the wilds of Gharve, the [[Danu]] wished to pave a path of redemption for the legendary hero. The great huntress, [[Cerninhas]] appeared to Sorbo and told him that to attain forgiveness for his unintentional murders, he would need to spend 100 years in service to the great masters of Amalthea.
