Known as the first [[Necromancy|Necromancer]], Zyweith is an ageless demigod that has dedicated his life to enslaving those that he has returned from death's domain. He has been the bane to a number of societies throughout the ages, and the many attempts to thwart his devilry have only amounted to temporary solutions. 

# Birth

A settlement in Northern [[Umayyad]] watched helplessly as the river that sustained their livelihood diminished more with each passing year. An [[Oracle]] passing through along the [[Rua Sedazul]] was consulted on how they might appease the gods and bring abundance back to their settlement. The soothsayer told them that the cycle of the land had turned into the realm of [[Múnla]], the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic God]] of decay, and that, only by appeasing him would he spare their village from its inevitable fate. 

The most tender young lady named [[Vallia Morrigan]] was chosen, for they sought to make a sacrifice of her to appease the Lord of Decay. As she lay bare on the altar stone, Múnla was so taken by her fearless beauty that he wished not to destroy her radiance, but to taste it. Taking the form of a great phallic mushroom, he filled the air with intoxicating pheromones that overwhelmed the maiden with lustful desires. She took the mushroom inside herself, and when she did the Cthonic God released his spores.

The the young woman returned to the village alive and pregnant rather than having performed her duty as sacrifice, she was cast out of the village. Each day she wandered the lands seeking a village that would accept her, and each night she paced a dark labyrinth in her mind. Trapped in a dreamlike haze, eventually Múnla lead her to his forbidden temple [[Templo Desmofado]] where she gave birth to her child.

# Early Life

Zyweith was raised by the clergy of the temple, and taught arcane secrets reserved only for the wisest elders of the mystery school. Seen as a divine gift from their Lord, the priests of Múnla treated the boy with the same reverence given to a king.

This material, however, warped the child's mind. Without the structural framework of a wise master, the advanced sorcery of decay clouded Zyweith's mind with promises of power and wrestling the dominion over the realm of the dead from the hands of the [[Primordial Blights|Primordial Blight]] [[Éachtach]]. Challenging the Primordial Gods was seen as profane, even among the worshipers in the temple of Decay, and Zyweith was cast out to pursue his dark purpose alone.

# Reports of Death

There have been multiple accounts of the death of a wizard by the name of Zyweith through the ages, usually after the discovery of one of his dreadful labs. 

Shortly after he was exiled from the Templo Desmofado, he took up work in [[Sagacidade]] as a professor at [[Quatrograde]] university in order to have access to the library of forbidden works. When he was exposed for attempting to reanimate the recently deceased, he was detained by guards from [[Luavila]] where he was tried and hanged.

Later his name popped up again in the employ of an influential band of [[Fixer|Reparadores]]. He had posted a false job about a beast prowling the tomb of the great magician [[Segomaro]], but after the band fought their way through the traps, he revealed his deception and plundered the vault of a number of powerful relics. The leader of the band claimed to have slain the evil necromancer and left his body entombed in the vault.

Most recently the name Zyweith resurfaced as the advisor to the King of [[Andaluz]]. After a number of heirloom books were reported missing from the treasury, it was discovered that they had been stolen by the necromancer after his laboratory was discovered in the [[Torre de Últivida]]. The wizard fled into the [[Lordless Lands]], and was pursued by [[Afonso Roche]] of the [[Ordem Etérea]]. Neither have been heard from since, and it was assumed that they both perished in the struggle.

Its possible that these were all different individuals, but it would be a great coincidence that each individual would be a powerful wizard seeking forbidden magical power. Other possibilities include the name being adopted by necromancers as a sort of honorific, or that the accounts are simply myth or legend.
