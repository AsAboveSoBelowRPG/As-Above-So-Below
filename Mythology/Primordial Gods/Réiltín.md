Réiltín is one of the [[Primordial Gods]] of [[Amalthea]]. He is often called "The Mentor of Heroes", "The Wounded Healer", or, derogatorily, "The Wise Horse". Though he has worked tirelessly to bring healing to the mortals, his work as a healer is often overshadowed by his involvement in the lives of his protégés, which include the famous heroes [[Sorbo]], [[Sibyl]] and many others.


His appearance is that of a [[Centaur]], but differs in a fundamental way.
