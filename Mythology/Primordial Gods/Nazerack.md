A God without a domain or a following, Nazerack is an enigmatic deity that came into being after the shattering of the [[Divine Unity]].  Because its name was seldom referenced outside a few early fables, Nazerack was largely dismissed as either a myth or as a dead god who failed to find a purpose and thus vanished from existence.

This theory was laid to rest in the year 3'071 when a wicked demigod [[Zyweith the Hollow]] called down the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial]] from the void of the heavens. Accounts from those who witnessed the descent from as far away as [[Salasandra]] claimed that the body blocked the sun from the sky, and the collision it made when it struck the earth was felt as far away as [[Porto Coelbren]].

While few were close enough to witness the event and survive, members of the Cartographer's Guild who surveyed the area in the days following reported that [[Castelo Ayodar]] had been entirely annihilated; leaving only a massive hole where it once stood. Subsequent earthquakes and landslides from the unstable geography eventually filled in the pit, and a lake now covers the alleged site of the incident.

Since that brief encounter, no one has seen Nazerack again. So much time has elapsed that many call the sighting into question, and the God has, again, slipped into a place of mythological consideration.
