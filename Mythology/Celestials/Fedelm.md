The Celestial Goddess of Prophecy, Fedelm is said to traverse the heavens in a red Gandelow boat festooned with exotic blankets of the softest fleece. She floats among the sky and sees all things and all the potential futures of these things. Many seek her wisdom, for only Fedelm can foresee the fates of even the [[Gods]]. As such, all Oracles seek her grace, and only by her divine wisdom are we allowed a glimpse into the future.

Idols of the Goddess always portray her in repose at the prow of her ship, holding a fishing rod in one hand. Images that depict her in the presence of mortals convey her massive scale compared to that of humanoids. Most typically she is illustrated wearing a silver cloak.

# Prophecy of the Dawn

> When the universe was young, shortly after the shattering of the [[Divine Unity]], Fedelm foresaw a great darkness settling in over the realms, as if the torch of hope had been extinguished. For several eternities, all would be eclipsed by this unspeakable void. When all hope was lost, the children of the flame will emerge from the void and vanquish the unending night, bringing, once more, warmth and light to the land.

Perhaps the most famous prophecy in the history of [[Amalthea]]; Fedelm foretold of the rise of the [[Cthonic Gods]], of [[Smoladh]]'s oppressive darkness, and of the birth of [[The Lightbringers]]. This prophecy was so profound that it even made its way into the depths of the Cthonic Realm, where the Lord of Shadows obsessed over the impending challenge.

Smoladh thought he could circumvent his fate by slaying the God of the Sun, [[Gréine]] before he could sire any offspring, but [[Sadhbh]] was able to fulfil this prophecy by conceiving with the corpse of her former lover. As such, the vision came to fruition and the dawn of [[The Common Light]] came to be.

# Worship

Those blessed by the gift of clairvoyance are said to be blessed by Fedelm, and are often sent, at a young age, to her temple in 

# Children

Few among the [[Gods]] hold the same radiant beauty as Fedelm, and fewer, still contain the same power she wields. As such, many have looked up at the red wake of her ship with desirous thoughts, sometimes of lust - others of power. Though some have climbed her ethereal fishing line to seek an audience with the Goddess, very few have earned her pleasure, as such, she has only three offspring.

The oldest of such, [[Ulliam]], is the God of Music and is credited as bringing instruments and song to the [[Tuatha]]. He was born when Fedelm's Gandelow scraped against the peak of [[Serra Lâmpada]]. The impact attracted the [[Cthonic Gods|Cthonic]] [[Talún]], God of Earthquakes, who came to investigate the crash. The infatuation was brief, but passionate.

A mortal hero, [[Caeneus]], was her next suitor. Legend says that Caeneus built a massive tower that reached to the bottom of the heavens. When Fedelm passed overhead on her annual transit, he grabbed a hold of her fishing line and climbed for three days until he boarded her vessel. As impressed with his perseverance as he was with her divine beauty, she acquiesced to lay together. Their daughter, the [[Demigods|Demigod]] [[Méabh Daibhéid|Méabh]] became the oracle of [[Anduantas]].

The youngest of her children was fathered by a musician named [[Temistocles]] who was a favored student of Ulliam. This child was born of deception, and when she realized she had been betrayed by a mortal, she couldn't bear the sight of the child. She lowered it to the earthly plane where it was found and raised by the [[Primordial Gods|Primordial]] [[Réiltín]]. Her name was [[Zell]], and she grew to be one of the wisest prophets Amalthea has known.
