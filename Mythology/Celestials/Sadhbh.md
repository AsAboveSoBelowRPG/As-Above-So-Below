Sadhbh is the [[Celestials|Celestial]] Goddess who reigns as the Queen of the Sky. She was birth at the shattering of the [[Divine Unity]], and has been a deeply influential deity during every age of life on [[Amalthea]], as the reigning deity of the sky, as the bother of [[The Lightbringers]], and as the firmament that keeps the lord of darkness at bay.

# First Light

Sadhbh was among the shards of the unity that were flung into the realm above, where she became the sky - a vast and sprawling realm where the other celestial gods took refuge. Among her kin was [[Gréine]], her lover and consort, who held the most prominent position in the realm of the sky. The God of the Sun sat high above Amalthea, showering all above and below with his nourishing radiance

These were golden times for the Celestials who lived in the realm of the sky; and none were happier than Gréine and Sadhbh, who nurtured a peaceful realm of abundance and joy.

# Death of the Sun & the Abduction of Sadhbh

Unbeknownst to the Celestials, the wicked God of Darkness, [[Smoladh]], was secretly plotting to destroy the source of light, which offended his realm. For centuries the [[Primordial Gods]] sought a way to end the reign of the sun.

Sneaking into the realm of the sky through the shadows of the celestial bodies, Smoladh was able to strike down the unsuspecting Gréine, an act that gave birth to the [[Primordial Blights|Blight]] [[Éachtach]]; the God of Death.  Before he fled back to his subterranean domain, Smoladh abducted Sadhbh and brought her back to the Cthonic realm where he forced her to become his bride.

With the realm of the sky defiled and left without its leaders, the Celesial Gods moved deeper into the ether, leaving the sky starless and without a sun. The lightless body of Gréine lay like a monument to Smoladh's brutality in in the dark void; a reminder to all of the supremecy of darkness.

# Birth of The Lightbringers

Smoladh's destructive reign was one of paranoia and suffering. Long ago an oracle told the Lord of Darkness that he would be struck down by the children of Gréine, and by slaying the Celestial God before he bore offspring, he felt he had circumvented fate, however, he lived in fear of this inevitability.

Sadhbh was also informed of this prophecy, and she carried the words with her through her suffering. Each day was a night, and each night an eternity. She felt so segregated from the peaceful wonders of her home in the sky; instead she was kept below ground where no light could find her.

It was under this pervasive darkness that Sadhbh snuck back to her kingdom and, remembering the prophecy, engaged in intercourse with the corpse of her fallen lover. She hid her pregnancy from the dark lord for nine decades, using the shadows to mask her form. When the time came to give birth she again snuck up to her realm in the sky and, using the body of her lover as a shield, gave birth to twins.

Unable to bring her children with her to the underworld, and knowing that her absence would bring the vengeful Cthonics in search of her, she left the two infants to mature in the sky behind the corpse of their father; and this body masked the growing luminescence of the children. During this time, the Celestial Gods brought gifts, offerings, teachings and guidance to the twins until their radiance grew too bright to hide.

# Return to the Realm of the Sky

[[Nuaré]] and [[Bánsolas]], the prophesized children, descended from their place in the heavens and waged war against the shadows of the Cthonic. Though the battle seemed to rage for an immeasurable time, eventually the twins managed to defeat the sinister Smoladh. The two banished him to the void beyond the sky.

Thus freed from her cavernous prison, Sadhb returned to the sky, where she enclosed all of her kin in an embrace, creating a barrier between the Sky and the beyond, trapping Smoladh forever outside. To this day, Sadhbh serves as the firmament between unspeakable evil and the prosperity of the light.
